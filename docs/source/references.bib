abstract = {The impact of several devastating hurricanes revealed the vulnerability of large areas of the U.S.A. to this catastrophic natural hazard. Therefore, especially considering the uncertainties in future climate and demographic conditions, exposure and vulnerability, there is a strong need to include storm surge predictions in hurricane risk analyses. In general, the models used for storm surge are unsuited for probabilistic studies that require a large number of simulations. This article presents a probabilistic formulation for storm surge predictions that are developed using the combination of a logistic model and a non-stationary random field. The proposed fully probabilistic formulation (i) provides the probability that a location is being flooded, (ii) considers the spatial correlation among the storm surge at different locations and (iii) predicts storm surge at locations that are different from those of the observations used for the model calibration and are not restricted to be alongshore. Such formulation can include the effects of climate change by calibrating the models with high-fidelity simulations that account for the effect of climate change performed using a realistic set of hurricanes. The proposed formulation is used to predict the storm surge in a specific geographic region near the Pamlico River in North Carolina.},

abstract = {A total variation diminishing Lax–Wendroff scheme has been applied to numerically solve the Boussinesq-type equations. The runup processes on a vertical wall and on a uniform slope by various waves, including solitary waves, leading-depression N-waves and leading-elevation N-waves, have been investigated using the developed numerical model. The results agree well with the runup laws derived analytically by other researchers for non-breaking waves. The predictions with respect to breaking solitary waves generally follow the empirical runup relationship established from laboratory experiments, although some degree of over-prediction on the runup heights has been manifested. Such an over-prediction can be attributed to the exaggeration of the short waves in the front of the breaking waves. The study revealed that the leading-depression N-wave produced a higher runup than the solitary wave of the same amplitude, whereas the leading-elevation N-wave produced a slightly lower runup than the solitary wave of the same amplitude. For the runup on a vertical wall, this trend becomes prominent when the wave height-to-depth ratio exceeds 0.01. For the runup on a slope, this trend is prominent before the strong wave breaking occurs.},

abstract = {AbstractA near-global chart of surface elevations associated with the stationary M2 internal tide is empirically constructed from multimission satellite altimeter data. An advantage of a strictly empirical mapping approach is that results are independent of assumptions about ocean wave dynamics and, in fact, can be used to test such assumptions. A disadvantage is that present-day altimeter coverage is only marginally adequate to support mapping such short-wavelength features. Moreover, predominantly north–south ground-track orientations and contamination from nontidal oceanographic variability can lead to deficiencies in mapped tides. Independent data from Cryosphere Satellite-2 (CryoSat-2) and other altimeters are used to test the solutions and show positive reduction in variance except in regions of large mesoscale variability. The tidal fields are subjected to two-dimensional wavenumber spectral analysis, which allows for the construction of an empirical map of modal wavelengths. Mode-1 wavelengths sho...},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.This paper presents a two-dimensional (2D)–three-dimensional (3D) hybrid stabilized finite element method that enables us to predict a propagation process of tsunami generated in a hypocentral region, which ranges from offshore propagation to runup to urban areas, with high accuracy and relatively low computational costs. To be more specific, the 2D shallow water equation is employed to simulate the propagation of offshore waves, while the 3D Navier–Stokes equation is employed for the runup in urban areas. The stabilized finite element method is utilized for numerical simulations for both of the 2D and 3D domains that are independently discretized with unstructured meshes. The multi-point constraint and transmission methods are applied to satisfy the continuity of flow velocities and pressures at the interface between the resulting 2D and 3D meshes, since neither their spatial dimensions nor node arrangements are consistent. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed hybrid method to simulate tsunami behavior, including offshore propagation and runup to urban areas, with substantially lower computation costs in comparison with full 3D computations.},

abstract = {The lack of a continental shelf in steep volcanic islands leads to significant changes in tropical cyclone inundation potential, with wave setup and runup increasing in importance and wind driven surge decreasing when compared to more gently-sloped mainland regions. This is illustrated through high resolution modeling of waves, surge, and runup on the Hawaiian Islands of Oahu and Kauai. A series of hurricane waves and water levels were computed using the SWAN. +. ADCIRC models for a suite of 643 synthetic storm scenarios, while local wave runup was evaluated along a series of 1D transects using the phase-resolving model Bouss1D. Waves are found to be an extremely important component of the inundation, both from breaking wave forced increases in storm surge and also from wave runup over the relatively steep topography. This is clear in comparisons with debris lines left by Hurricane Iniki on the Island of Kauai, where runup penetration is much greater than still water inundation in most instances. The difference between steeply-sloping and gently-sloping topographies was demonstrated by recomputing Iniki with the same landfall location as Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana. Surge was greatly increased for the mild-slope Iniki-in-Louisiana case, while pure wind surge for Iniki-in-Kauai was very small. For the entire suite of storms, maxima on Kauai show predicted inundation largely confined to a narrow coastal strip, with few locations showing more than a few hundred meters of flooding from the shoreline. As expected, maximum flooded areas for the 643 storms were somewhat greater than the Iniki inundation. Oahu has significantly more low-lying land compared to Kauai, and consequently hypothetical tropical cyclone landfalls show much more widespread inundation. Under direct impact scenarios, there is the potential for much of Honolulu and most of Waikiki to be inundated, with both still water surge and wave runup contributing. Other regions of Oahu show inundation confined to a more narrow coastal strip, although there is still much infrastructure at risk. Even for very strong storms in Oahu and Kauai, maximum still water surge is relatively small, and does not exceed 3. m in any storm modeled. In contrast, hurricane waves several kilometers from shore regularly exceed 10. m due to the lack of a continental shelf. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

While mesh-based methods have several problems in dealing with the fragmentation of geometry and moving interfaces and with the instability of nonlinear advective terms, mesh-free particle methods can deal with free surface and moving boundary relatively easily. In structural analyses, the finite element method, which is a mesh-based method, has been investigated extensively and can accurately deal with not only elastic problems but also plastic and fracture problems. Thus, the present study proposes a partitioned coupling strategy for fluid–structure interaction problems involving free surfaces and moving boundaries that calculates the fluid domain using the moving particle simulation method and the structure domain using the finite element method. As the first step, we apply a conventional serial staggered algorithm as a weak coupling scheme. In addition, for the...},

abstract = {A nested Finite-Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) inundation forecast model has been developed for Scituate (MA) as part of the Northeast Coastal Ocean Forecast System (NECOFS). Scituate Harbor is a small coastal lagoon oriented north-south with a narrow entrance (with opposing breakwaters) opening eastward onto Massachusetts Bay and the Gulf of Maine. On 27 December 2010, a classic nor'easter produced a ∼0.9 m high surge, which when added to the ∼1.5 m high tide and seasonal higher mean water level, produced significant inundation in Scituate. The Scituate FVCOM inundation model includes flooding/drying, seawall/breakwater, and wave-current interaction capabilities, and was driven by one-way nesting with NECOFS. Hindcasts of the 27 December nor'easter event were made with two different resolution Scituate FVCOM grids with and without inclusion of wave-current interaction to examine the influence of spatial resolution and model dynamics on the predicted flooding. In all simulations, a wind-driven coastal current flowed southward across the harbor entrance, with an attached separation eddy forming downstream of the northern breakwater and rapid decrease in wave energy entering the harbor. With wave-current interaction, the southward coastal current was strongly enhanced and currents within the separation eddy increased to more than 1 m/s, making it highly nonlinear with large lateral shears. Comparisons of the model water elevation time series with harbor tide station measurements showed that inclusion of wave-current interaction increased the peak model surge by ∼8 cm, in closer agreement with the observed peak.},

Here I define an index of the potential destructiveness of hurricanes based on the total dissipation of power, integrated over the lifetime of the cyclone, and show that this index has increased markedly since the mid-1970s. This trend is due to both longer storm lifetimes and greater storm intensities. I find that the record of net hurricane power dissipation is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature, reflecting well-documented climate signals, including multi-decadal oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and global warming. My results suggest that future warming may lead to an upward trend in tropical cyclone destructive potential, and-taking into account an increasing coastal population-a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century.},

The model [Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS)] estimates of conversion compare well with inviscid and nondiffusive theory in the sub- and supercritical regimes and are insensitive to the strength of viscosity and diffusivity. In the supercritical regime, the nondissipative analytic solution is singular all along the internal tide beams. Because of dissipation the ROMS solutions are nonsingular, although the density gradients are strongly enhanced along the beams.

abstract = {The operational forecast demands and constraints of the National Hurricane Center require that a storm surge model in research mode be tested against a benchmark model such as Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) for accuracy, computation time, and numerical stability before the model is used for operational forecasts. Additionally, the simulated results must be in a geographic information system format to facilitate the usage of computed storm surge for various applications. This paper presents results from a demonstration project to explore the pathway for the transition of the Coastal and Estuarine Storm Tide (CEST) model to an operational forecast model by testing CEST over SLOSH basins in Florida. The performance and stability of CEST were examined by conducting simulations for Hurricane Andrew (1992) and more than 100 000 synthetic hurricanes for nine SLOSH basins covering the Florida coast and Lake Okeechobee. The results show that CEST produces peak surge heights similar to those from SLOSH. Additionally, CEST has proven to be numerically stable against all synthetic hurricanes and the computation time of CEST is comparable to that of SLOSH. Therefore, CEST has the potential to be used for operational forecasts of storm surge. The potential of producing more detailed real-time surge inundation forecasts was also investigated through the simulations of Andrew's surge on various grids with different cell sizes. The results indicate that CEST can produce 48-h forecasts using a single processor in about 40 min over a grid generated by reducing the cell edge size of the SLOSH grid by 4 times . {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Many studies have modeled the Tohoku tsunami of March 11, 2011 as being due entirely to slip on an earthquake fault, but the following discrepancies suggest that further research is warranted. (1) Published models of tsunami propagation and coastal impact underpredict the observed runup heights of up to 40m measured along the coast of the Sanriku district in the northeast part of Honshu Island. (2) Published models cannot reproduce the timing and high-frequency content of tsunami waves recorded at three nearshore buoys off Sanriku, nor the timing and dispersion properties of the waveforms at offshore DART buoy {\#}21418. (3) The rupture centroids obtained by tsunami inversions are biased about 60km NNE of that obtained by the Global CMT Project. Based on an analysis of seismic and geodetic data, together with recorded tsunami waveforms, we propose that, while the primary source of the tsunami was the vertical displacement of the seafloor due to the earthquake, an additional tsunami source is also required. We infer the location of the proposed additional source based on an analysis of the travel times of higher-frequency tsunami waves observed at nearshore buoys. We further propose that the most likely additional tsunami source was a submarine mass failure (SMF—i.e., a submarine landslide). A comparison of pre- and post-tsunami bathymetric surveys reveals tens of meters of vertical seafloor movement at the proposed SMF location, and a slope stability analysis confirms that the horizontal acceleration from the earthquake was sufficient to trigger an SMF. Forward modeling of the tsunami generated by a combination of the earthquake and the SMF reproduces the recorded on-, near- and offshore tsunami observations well, particularly the high-frequency component of the tsunami waves off Sanriku, which were not well simulated by previous models. The conclusion that a significant part of the 2011 Tohoku tsunami was generated by an SMF source has important implications for estimates of tsunami hazard in the Tohoku region as well as in other tectonically similar regions.},

Precise calculations of arrival times are essential for reliable early warning systems, determination of source and earth properties using the inverse problem, and time series modulation due to frequency dependency of phase speed. Far field observatories show a systematic discrepancy between observed and calculated arrival times. Models in present use and based on incompressible hydrodynamics and interacnces exceeding tens of minutes. These models neglect the simultaneous effects of the slight tion with a rigid ocean floor overestimate the phase speed of tsunamis, leading to arrival time differecompressibility of water, sea-bed elasticity, and static compression of the ocean under gravity, hereinafter gravity. Here, we show that taking these effects into account results in more accurate phase speeds and travel times that agree with observations. Moreover, the semi-analytical model that we propose can be employed near real-time, which is essential for early warning inverse models and mitigation systems that rely on accurate phase speed calculations.},

abstract = {Coastal protection design heights typically consider the superimposed effects of tides, surges, waves, and relative sea-level rise (SLR), neglecting non-linear feedbacks between these forcing factors. Here, we use hydrodynamic modelling and multivariate statistics to show that shallow coastal areas are extremely sensitive to changing non-linear interactions between individual components caused by SLR. As sea-level increases, the depth-limitation of waves relaxes, resulting in waves with larger periods, greater amplitudes, and higher run-up; moreover, depth and frictional changes affect tide, surge, and wave characteristics, altering the relative importance of other risk factors. Consequently, sea-level driven changes in wave characteristics, and to a lesser extent, tides, amplify the resulting design heights by an average of 48-56{\%}, relative to design changes caused by SLR alone. Since many of the world's most vulnerable coastlines are impacted by depth-limited waves, our results suggest that the overall influence of SLR may be greatly underestimated in many regions.},

abstract = {A catastrophic flood event which causedmassive economic losses occurred in Thailand, in 2011. Several studies have already been conducted to analyze the Thai floods, but none of themhave assessed the impacts of reservoir operation on flood inundation. This study addresses this gap by combining physically based hydrologicalmodels to explicitly simulate the impacts of reservoir operation on flooding in the Chao Phraya River Basin, Thailand. H08, an integrated water resources model with a reservoir operationmodule, was combined with CaMa-Flood, a river routingmodel with representation of flood dynamics. The combined H08-CaMa model was applied to simulate and assess the historical and alternative reservoir operation rules in the two largest reservoirs in the basin. The combined H08-CaMamodel effectively simulated the 2011 flood: regulated flows at a major gauging station have high daily NSE-coefficient of 92{\%} as compared with observed discharge; spatiotemporal extent of simulated flood inundationmatch well with those of satellite observa- tions. Simulation results show that through the operation of reservoirs in 2011, flood volume was reduced by 8.6 billionm3 and both depth and area of flooding were reduced by 40{\%} on the average. Nonetheless, simple modifications in reservoir operation proved to further reduce the flood volume by 2.4millionm3 and the depth and area of flooding by 20{\%} on the average. Bymodeling reservoir operation with a hydrodynamic model, amore realistic simulation of the 2011 Thai flood was made possible, and the potential of reducing flood inundation through improved reservoir management was quantified},

abstract = {The link between secular changes in the lunar semidiurnal ocean tide (M2) and relative sea level rise is examined based on numerical tidal modeling and the analysis of long-term sea level records from Europe, Australia, and the North American Atlantic coasts. The study sets itself apart fromprevious work by using a 1∕12∘ global tide model that incorporates the effects of self-attraction and loading through time-step-wise spherical harmonic transforms instead of iteration. This novel self-attraction and loading implementation incurs moderate computational overheads (some 50{\%}) and facilitates the simulation of shelf sea tides with a global root mean square error of 14.6 cm in depths shallower than 1,000 m. To reproduce measured tidal changes in recent decades, the model is perturbed with realistic water depth changes, compiled from maps of altimetric sea level trends and postglacial crustal rebound. The M2 response to the adopted sea level rise scenarios exhibits peak sensitivities in the North Atlantic and many marginal seas, with relative magnitudes of 1–5{\%} per century. Comparisons with a collection of 45 tide gauge records reveals that the model reproduces the sign of the observed amplitude trends in 80{\%} of the cases and captures considerable fractions of the absoluteM2 variability, specifically for stations in the Gulf of Mexico and the Chesapeake-Delaware Bay system. While measured-to-model disparities remain large in several key locations, such as the European Shelf, the study is deemed a major step toward credible predictions of secular changes in the main components of the ocean tide. 1.},

abstract = {Using Boussinesq scaling for water waves while imposing no constraints on rotationality, we derive and test model equations for nonlinear water wave transformation over varying depth. These use polynomial basis functions to create velocity profiles which are inserted into the basic equations of motion keeping terms up to the desired Boussinesq scaling order, and solved in a weighted residual sense. The models show rapid convergence to exact solutions for linear dispersion, shoaling, and orbital velocities; however, properties may be substantially improved for a given order of approximation using asymptotic rearrangements. This improvement is accomplished using the large numbers of degrees of freedom inherent in the definitions of the polynomial basis functions either to match additional terms in a Taylor series, or to minimize errors over a range. Explicit coefficients are given at O($\mu$2) and O($\mu$4), while more generalized basis functions are given at higher order. Nonlinear performance is somewhat more limited as, for reasons of complexity, we only provide explicitly lower order nonlinear terms. Still, second order harmonics may remain good to kh≈10 for O($\mu$4) equations. Numerical tests for wave transformation over a shoal show good agreement with experiments. Future work will harness the full rotational performance of these systems by incorporating turbulent and viscous stresses into the equations, making them into surf zone models.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a detailed energy budget of the M2 ocean tides over the world ocean, based on the hydrodynamic tidal solution FES94.1 which includes not only the characteristics of the sea surface tidal elevations, but also of the tidal currents. Global and regional budgets are given. The global energy input by astronomical forcing, deduced from the (2,2) spherical harmonic development of the M2 sea surface elevation solution, is 2.35 TW (lower by 0.1 TW than for the new altimetric solutions produced recently directly from satellite observations). One major feature emerging from the present analysis is that a quarter of this energy input takes place over the South Atlantic Ocean. On the other hand, ocean tides work against astronomical forcing over three areas: Eastern Indian Ocean, southwest of the South American Continent, and around New Zealand. This energy is dissipated (in FES94.1) by bottom friction over the main continental shelves, but the outstanding feature is that 40{\%} of the tidal energy is dissipated over the North Atlantic Ocean. Energy is thus redistributed from the areas of energy input to feed the areas of dissipation. The Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the South Atlantic Ocean receive more energy in total than they dissipate, in contrast with the Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean, where a large deficit must be compensated by a net influx of energy from the other basins. One third of the total M2 energy input by astronomical forcing over the world ocean flows northwards through the Equatorial Atlantic. Detailed energy dissipation estimates are computed over the different areas of energy dissipation and compared to the previous estimates published in the literature.},

abstract = {The southern coast of the Gulf of Maine in the United States is prone to flooding caused by nor'easters. A state-of-the-art fully-coupled model, the Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model with unstructured grids and the ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) model, was used to study the hydrodynamic response in the Gulf of Maine during the Patriot's Day storm of 2007, a notable example of nor'easters in this area. The model predictions agree well with the observed tide-surges and waves during this storm event. Waves and circulation in the Gulf of Maine were analyzed. The Georges Bank plays an important role in dissipating wave energy through the bottom friction when waves propagate over the bank from offshore to the inner gulf due to its shallow bathymetry. Wave energy dissipation results in decreasing significant wave height (SWH) in the cross-bank direction and wave radiation stress gradient, which in turn induces changes in currents. While the tidal currents are dominant over the Georges Bank and in the Bay of Fundy, the residual currents generated by the meteorological forcing and waves are significant over the Georges Bank and in the coastal area and can reach 0.3 m/s and 0.2 m/s, respectively. In the vicinity of the coast, the longshore current generated by the surface wind stress and wave radiation stress acting parallel to the coastline is inversely proportional to the water depth and will eventually be limited by the bottom friction. The storm surge level reaches 0.8 m along the western periphery of the Gulf of Maine while the wave set-up due to radiation stress variation reaches 0.2 m. Therefore, it is significant to coastal flooding.},

abstract = {The breaking of internal tides is believed to provide a large part of the power needed to mixthe abyssal ocean and sustain the meridional overturning circulation. Both the fraction of internal tideenergy that is dissipated locally and the resulting vertical mixing distribution are crucial for the ocean state,but remain poorly quantiﬁed. Here we present a ﬁrst worldwide estimate of mixing due to internal tidesgenerated at small-scale abyssal hills. Our estimate is based on linear wave theory, a nonlinear parameter-ization for wave breaking and uses quasi-global small-scale abyssal hill bathymetry, stratiﬁcation, and tidaldata. We show that a large fraction of abyssal-hill generated internal tide energy is locally dissipated overmid-ocean ridges in the Southern Hemisphere. Signiﬁcant dissipation occurs above ridge crests, and, uponrescaling by the local stratiﬁcation, follows a monotonic exponential decay with height off the bottom, witha nonuniform decay scale. We however show that a substantial part of the dissipation occurs over thesmoother ﬂanks of mid-ocean ridges, and exhibits a middepth maximum due to the interplay of waveamplitude with stratiﬁcation. We link the three-dimensional map of dissipation to abyssal hills characteris-tics, ocean stratiﬁcation, and tidal forcing, and discuss its potential implementation in time-evolving param-eterizations for global climate models. Current tidal parameterizations only account for waves generated atlarge-scale satellite-resolved bathymetry. Our results suggest that the presence of small-scale, mostly unre-solved abyssal hills could signiﬁcantly enhance the spatial inhomogeneity of tidal mixing, particularly abovemid-ocean ridges in the Southern Hemisphere.},

Through the dynamic adjustment of the sea surface in response to a possible slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation1, 2, a warming climate could also affect regional sea levels, especially in the North Atlantic region3, leading to high vulnerability for low-lying Florida and western Europe4, 5, 6. Here we analyse climate projections from a set of state-of-the-art climate models for such regional changes, and find a rapid dynamical rise in sea level on the northeast coast of the United States during the twenty-first century. For New York City, the rise due to ocean circulation changes amounts to 15, 20 and 21 cm for scenarios with low, medium and high rates of emissions respectively, at a similar magnitude to expected global thermal expansion. Analysing one of the climate models in detail, we find that a dynamic, regional rise in sea level is induced by a weakening meridional overturning circulation in the Atlantic Ocean, and superimposed on the global mean sea-level rise. We conclude that together, future changes in sea level and ocean circulation will have a greater effect on the heavily populated northeastern United States than estimated previously7, 8, 9.},

abstract = {Abstract. Altimeter measurements are corrected for several geophysical parameters in order to access ocean signals of interest, like mesoscale or sub-mesoscale variability. The ocean tide is one of the most critical corrections due to the amplitude of the tidal elevations and to the aliasing phenomena of high-frequency signals into the lower-frequency band, but the internal-tide signatures at the ocean surface are not yet corrected globally. Internal tides can have a signature of several centimeters at the surface with wavelengths of about 50–250 km for the first mode and even smaller scales for higher-order modes. The goals of the upcoming Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission and other high-resolution ocean measurements make the correction of these small-scale signals a challenge, as the correction of all tidal variability becomes mandatory to access accurate measurements of other oceanic signals. In this context, several scientific teams are working on the development of new internal-tide models, taking advantage of the very long altimeter time series now available, which represent an unprecedented and valuable global ocean database. The internal-tide models presented here focus on the coherent internal-tide signal and they are of three types: empirical models based upon analysis of existing altimeter missions, an assimilative model and a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. A detailed comparison and validation of these internal-tide models is proposed using existing satellite altimeter databases. The analysis focuses on the four main tidal constituents: M2, K1, O1 and S2. The validation process is based on a statistical analysis of multi-mission altimetry including Jason-2 and Cryosphere Satellite-2 data. The results show a significant altimeter variance reduction when using internal-tide corrections in all ocean regions where internal tides are generating or propagating. A complementary spectral analysis also gives some estimation of the performance of each model as a function of wavelength and some insight into the residual non-stationary part of internal tides in the different regions of interest. This work led to the implementation of a new internal-tide correction (ZARON'one) in the next geophysical data records version-F (GDR-F) standards.},

abstract = {Tsunamis, or “harbor waves” in Japanese, are so-named due to common observations of enhanced wave heights, currents and damage in harbors and ports. However, dynamic currents induced by these waves, while regularly observed and known to cause significant damage, are poorly understood. Observations and modeling of the currents induced by the 2011 Tohoku and 2004 Indian Ocean tsunamis allows us to show that the strongest flows in harbor basins are governed by horizontally sheared and rotational shallow features, such as jets and large eddies. When examining currents in harbors, this conclusion will generally require a simulation approach that both includes the relevant physical processes in the governing equations and uses a numerical scheme that does not artificially damp these features. Without proper representation of the physics associated with these phenomena, predictive models may provide drag force estimates that are an order of magnitude or more in error. The immediate implementation of this type of analysis into tsunami hazard studies can mean the difference between an unaffected port and one in which 300m long container vessels are detached from their moorings and drift chaotically.},

abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) poses a hazard to ecosystems and economies in low-lying coastal and estuarine areas. To better understand the potential impacts of SLR in estuaries, a comprehensive review of existing theory, literature, and assessment tools is undertaken. In addition, several conceptual models are introduced to assist in understanding interlinked estuarine processes and their complex responses to SLR. This review indicates that SLR impacts in estuaries should not be assessed via static (bathtub) approaches as they fail to consider important hydrodynamic effects such as tidal wave amplification, dampening, and reflection. Where hydrodynamic models are used, the existing literature provides a relatively detailed understanding of how SLR will affect estuarine hydrodynamics (e.g., tides and inundation regimes). With regards to the current understanding of, and ability to model, the connections between altered hydrodynamics (under SLR) and dependent geomorphic, ecological, and bio-geochemical processes, significant knowledge gaps remain. This is of particular concern as there is currently a paradigm shift towards more integrated and holistic management of estuaries. Estuarine management under accelerating SLR is likely to become increasingly complex, as decision-making will be undertaken with uncertainty. As such, this review highlights that there is a fundamental requirement for more sophisticated and interdisciplinary studies that integrate physical, ecological, bio-geochemical, and geomorphic responses of estuaries to SLR.},

abstract = {This paper describes storm surge simulations made for Sandy (2012) for the Metropolitan New York (NYC) area using the Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) model forced by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The atmospheric forecast uncertainty was quantified using 11-members from an atmospheric Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) system. A control WRF member re-initialized every 24 h demonstrated the capability of the WRF-ADCIRC models to realistically simulate the 2.83 m surge and 4.40 m storm tide (surge + astronomical tide) above mean lower low water (MLLW) for NYC. Starting about four days before landfall, an ensemble of model runs based on the 11 “best” meteorological predictions illustrate how modest changes in the track (20–100 km) and winds (3–5 m s−1) of Sandy approaching the New Jersey coast and NYC can lead to relatively large (0.50–1.50 m) storm surge variations. The ensemble also illustrates the extreme importance of the timing of landfall relative to local high tide. The observed coastal flooding was not the worst case for this particular event. Had Sandy made landfall at differing times, locations and stages of the tide, peak water levels could have been up to 0.5 m higher than experienced.},

abstract = {Analysis of a global eddy-resolving simulation using the NEMO general circulation model is presented. The model has 1/16° horizontal spacing at the Equator, employs two displaced poles in the Northern Hemisphere, and uses 98 vertical levels. The simulation was spun up from rest and integrated for 11 model years, using ERA-Interim reanalysis as surface forcing. Primary intent of this hindcast is to test how the model represents upper ocean characteristics and sea ice properties. Analysis of the zonal averaged temperature and salinity, and the mixed layer depth indicate that the model average state is in good agreement with observed fields and that the model successfully represents the variability in the upper ocean and at intermediate depths. Comparisons against observational estimates of mass transports through key straits indicate that most aspects of the model circulation are realistic. As expected, the simulation exhibits turbulent behaviour and the spatial distribution of the sea surface height (SSH) variability from the model is close to the observed pattern. The distribution and volume of the sea ice are, to a large extent, comparable to observed values. Compared with a corresponding eddy-permitting configuration, the performance of the model is significantly improved: reduced temperature and salinity biases, in particular at intermediate depths, improved mass and heat transports, better representation of fluxes through narrow and shallow straits, and increased global-mean eddy kinetic energy (by ∼ 40 {\%}). However, relatively minor weaknesses still exist such as a lower than observed magnitude of the SSH variability. We conclude that the model output is suitable for broader analysis to better understand upper ocean dynamics and ocean variability at global scales. This simulation represents a major step forward in the global ocean modelling at the Euro-Mediterranean Centre on Climate Change and constitutes the groundwork for future applications to short-range ocean forecasting.},

abstract = {Coastal storm surge hazard assessment has received increased attention due to major hurricane events in the last two decades. Robust hazard assessment requires accurate and efficient storm surge prediction models; however, existing numerical models are either high-fidelity but computationally demanding or low-fidelity but with real-time forecasting application. This dichotomy has prompted the development of surrogate models that leverage available synthetic/historical storm databases to build prediction models intended to better balance efficiency and accuracy. Despite numerous studies that have examined the application of various surrogate modeling methods in coastal response prediction, no study is available that compares all of the frequently used methods for storm surge prediction. Furthermore, in most of these studies, the discussion of the performance of these models is bounded to aggregated error metrics (e.g., RMSE, R). This study aims to provide a comprehensive framework for comparison and assessment of the performance of surrogate models based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) for predicting storm surge. The United States Army Corp of Engineers' North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study (NACCS) database is used for developing the models at representative coastal locations. In this study, the performance of the models is explored by investigating the stability of performance across training sample sizes, identifying systematic trends in errors, assessing performance in predicting large target response quantities, and characterizing the distribution of error. The results indicate that the performance of surrogate models may be improved by use of physically-motivated parameter scaling and that the selection of a surrogate modeling method should be informed by factors such as consistency in performance under a range of target surge elevations. In particular, the results suggest that accuracy of the tested surrogate models may be a function of the target surge elevation. Furthermore, results suggest that model performance should be assessed using factors beyond aggregate error metrics because such measures (particularly when used without modification to focus on risk-significant events) may give incomplete information about performance of surrogate models.},

Since then, the basic algorithm has been studied and tested extensively; with subsequent modifications and extensions, it has proven to be a computationally efficient, reliable algorithm for predicting the hydrodynamic behavior of coastal and oceanic waters. Modifications over the last 20 years can be broken into two broad, but inter-related classes: 1) changes to the numerical algorithm, e.g., implicit time-marching or higher order elements; 2) incorporating more of the underlying physics into the mathematical formulation, e.g., baroclinic forcing or wetting and drying of near-shore elements. This manuscript summarizes the algorithm's evolution and highlights some its strengths as well as its shortcomings. It closes with some observations about the future of shallow water algorithms based on the generalized wave continuity (GWC) equation.},

@article{Sullivan2008,
abstract = {Winds and waves in marine boundary layers are often in an unsettled state when fast-running swell generated by distant storms propagates into local regions and modifies the overlying turbulent fields. A large-eddy simulation (LES) model with the capability to resolve a moving sinusoidal wave at its lower boundary is developed to investigate this low-wind/fast-wave regime. It is used to simulate idealized situations with wind following and opposing fast-propagating waves (swell), and stationary bumps. LES predicts momenturn transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere for wind following swell, and this can greatly modify the turbulence production mechanism in the marine surface layer. In certain circumstances the generation of a low-level jet reduces the mean shear between the surface layer and the PBL top, resulting in a near collapse of turbulence in the PBL. When light winds oppose the propagating swell, turbulence levels increase over the depth of the boundary layer and the surface drag increases by a factor of 4 compared to a flat surface. The mean wind profile, turbulence variances, and vertical momentum flux are then dependent on the state of the wave field. The LES results are compared with measurements from the Coupled Boundary Layers Air-Sea Transfer (CBLAST) field campaign. A quadrant analysis of the momentum flux from CBLAST verifies a wave age dependence predicted by the LES solutions. The measured bulk drag coefficient CD then depends on wind speed and wave state. In situations with light wind following swell, CD is approximately 50{\%} lower than values obtained from standard bulk parameterizations that have no sea state dependence. In extreme cases with light wind and persistent swell, CD {\textless} 0. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The frictional influence of the seabed on the tidal flow in shelf seas and estuaries is usually modelled via a prescribed, spatially/temporally invariant drag coefficient. In practice, the seabed exhibits considerable variability, particularly spatially, that should in principle be included in simulations. Local variations in the seabed roughness (ks) alter the flow strength and, hence, local sediment transport rates. The effect of using a spatially/temporally varying ksis assessed here with reference to a tidal channel (Menai Strait, N. Wales) in which the variability of the bedforms has been monitored using multi-beam surveying. The channel not only exhibits strong tidal flow, but also a residual induced flow that is used here as diagnostic to assess various bed roughness formulations tested in a Telemac model. Tidal simulations have been carried out with both constant and temporally/spatially variable ks, and the predicted residual flow is shown to be sensitive to these representations. For a mean spring-neap (SN) cycle with variable ks, the average residual flow is calculated to be 525 m3s− 1, consistent with observations. This residual flow can be recovered using imposed, constant values of ksin the range 0.15 m to 0.3 m. The results suggest that the overall, effective roughness of the seabed is less than half of the maximum local roughness due to the dunes in mid-channel, but more than the spatially-averaged ksvalue in the channel as a whole by about 50{\%}. Simulations carried out with an M2-alone tide using variable ksproduce a somewhat smaller (by 7{\%}) residual flow of 491 m3s− 1. The use of an ‘equivalent M2' tide of amplitude enhanced by 7.3{\%} reconciles these estimates. The main contribution to ksis made by dunes which are modelled using Van Rijn's (2007) formulation subject to an additional ‘history effect'. The modelled ksis found to equal approximately the observed height of the dunes along mid-channel transects rather than half the height as expected. This is attributed to the non-equilibrium nature of the bedforms in the reversing tidal flow, which exhibited shorter wavelength and more symmetrical profiles than dunes in steady flow.},

abstract = {Momentum and scalar transport in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) is driven by a turbulent mix of winds, buoyancy, and surface gravity waves. To investigate the interaction between these processes, a large-eddy simulation (LES) model is developed with the capability to impose a broadband spectrum of time-varying finite-amplitude surface waves at its lower boundary. The LES model adopts a Boussinesq flow model and integrates the governing equations on a time-varying, surface-fitted, nonorthogonal mesh using cell-centered variables with special attention paid to the solution of the pressure Poisson equation near the wavy boundary. Weakly unstable MABLs are simulated with geostrophic winds increasing from 5 to 25ms-1 and wave age varying from swell-dominated to wind-wave equilibrium. The simulations illustrate cross-scale coupling as wave-impacted near-surface turbulence transitions into shear-convective rolls with increasing distance from the water. In a regime with swell, low winds, and weak heating, wave-induced vertical velocity and pressure signals are readily observed well above the standard reference height $\zeta$a = 10 m. At wind-wave equilibrium, the small-scale wave-induced signals are detectable only near the water surface. Below $\zeta$a, a nearly-constant-flux layer is observed where the momentum flux carried by turbulence, form stress, and subgrid-scale motions shifts with varying wave age and distance above the water. The spectral content of the surface form stress is wave-age dependent, especially at low wavenumbers. The LES wind profiles deviate from Monin-Obukhov similarity theory in nonequilibrium wind-wave conditions, and entrainment is greatly enhanced by shear-induced engulfment events.},

abstract = {This study discusses the development and performance of a rapid prediction system capable of representing the joint rainfall-runoff and storm surge flood response of tropical cyclones (TCs) for probabilistic risk analysis. Due to the computational demand required for accurately representing storm surge with the high-fidelity ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) hydrodynamic model and its coupling with additional numerical models to represent rainfall-runoff, a surrogate or statistical model was trained to represent the relationship between hurricane wind- and pressure-field characteristics and their peak joint flood response typically determined from physics based numerical models. This builds upon past studies that have only evaluated surrogate models for predicting peak surge, and provides the first system capable of probabilistically representing joint flood levels from TCs. The utility of this joint flood prediction system is then demonstrated by improving upon probabilistic TC flood risk products, which currently account for storm surge but do not take into account TC associated rainfall-runoff. Results demonstrate the source apportionment of rainfall-runoff versus storm surge and highlight that slight increases in flood risk levels may occur due to the interaction between rainfall-runoff and storm surge as compared to the Federal Emergency Management Association's (FEMAs) current practices.},

The comparison has been made for the cross-stream velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, Reynolds stress, and wall shear stress. It is found that the original model is superior to the more recent models by virtue of its numerically desirable boundary conditions and accuracy of prediction for mean flow properties. A brief description about the wall-limiting behavior of important turbulent quantities is presented to recognize physically correct k-$\epsilon$ models.},

abstract = {We present a polynomial chaos-based framework to quantify the uncertainties in predicting hurricane-induced storm surges. Perturbation strategies are proposed to characterize poorly known time-dependent input parameters, such as tropical cyclone track and wind as well as space-dependent bottom stresses, using a handful of stochastic variables. The input uncertainties are then propagated through an ensemble calculation and a model surrogate is constructed to represent the changes in model output caused by changes in the model input. The statistical analysis is then performed using the model surrogate once its reliability has been established. The procedure is illustrated by simulating the flooding caused by Hurricane Gustav 2008 using the ADvanced CIRCulation model. The hurricane's track and intensity are perturbed along with the bottom friction coefficients. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the track of the tropical cyclone is the dominant contributor to the peak water level forecast, while uncertainties in wind speed and in the bottom friction coefficient show minor contributions. Exceedance probability maps with different levels are also estimated to identify the most vulnerable areas.},

abstract = {Annular flumes are often used to quantify the interactions between hydrodynamics, biological activity and sediment dynamics. Therefore it is essential that experimental laboratory flume systems adequately replicate natural conditions occurring in the field. This paper applies the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) approach to the determination of bed shear stresses ($\tau$0) on natural sediments from several sites in southern England and briefly discusses the advantages of this method compared to alternatives (log-profile) in the context of a combined flume and field study. Sediments studied varied in roughness length from 0.0013–1.18×10−3m (drag coefficient 0.0017–0.0204) and exhibited a non-linear increase in bed shear stress with increasing current velocity. The slope of this relationship increased also with increasing bed roughness. Several ‘smooth' sediments (roughness length {\textless}0.0036×10−3m, CD {\textless}0.0024) showed very similar relationships between bed shear stress and current velocity, enabling estimation of bed shear stress from velocity measurements alone. Results from flume studies showed the suitability of open cell polyurethane foam to act as a surrogate smooth sediment in laboratory investigations. Data presented here for natural sediments shows that comparison of bed shear stress versus current velocity in a laboratory annular flume with data for the same sediments in the field reveal very similar relationships, highlighting the suitability of laboratory annular flume systems as platforms to study critical bed shear stress and critical erosion velocity of natural sediments under near-natural conditions.},

@article{Candy2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} Author(s) 2018. The approaches taken to describe and develop spatial discretisations of the domains required for geophysical simulation models are commonly ad hoc, model- or application-specific, and under-documented. This is particularly acute for simulation models that are flexible in their use of multi-scale, anisotropic, fully unstructured meshes where a relatively large number of heterogeneous parameters are required to constrain their full description. As a consequence, it can be difficult to reproduce simulations, to ensure a provenance in model data handling and initialisation, and a challenge to conduct model intercomparisons rigorously. This paper takes a novel approach to spatial discretisation, considering it much like a numerical simulation model problem of its own. It introduces a generalised, extensible, self-documenting approach to carefully describe, and necessarily fully, the constraints over the heterogeneous parameter space that determine how a domain is spatially discretised. This additionally provides a method to accurately record these constraints, using high-level natural language based abstractions that enable full accounts of provenance, sharing, and distribution. Together with this description, a generalised consistent approach to unstructured mesh generation for geophysical models is developed that is automated, robust and repeatable, quick-to-draft, rigorously verified, and consistent with the source data throughout. This interprets the description above to execute a self-consistent spatial discretisation process, which is automatically validated to expected discrete characteristics and metrics.

abstract = {This paper establishes various advancements for the application of surrogate modeling techniques for storm surge prediction utilizing an existing database of high-fidelity, synthetic storms (tropical cyclones). Kriging, also known as Gaussian process regression, is specifically chosen as the surrogate model in this study. Emphasis is first placed on the storm selection for developing the database of synthetic storms. An adaptive, sequential selection is examined here that iteratively identifies the storm (or multiple storms) that is expected to provide the greatest enhancement of the prediction accuracy when that storm is added into the already available database. Appropriate error statistics are discussed for assessing convergence of this iterative selection, and its performance is compared to the joint probability method with optimal sampling, utilizing the required number of synthetic storms to achieve the same level of accuracy as comparison metric. The impact on risk estimation is also examined. The discussion then moves to adjustments of the surrogate modeling framework to support two implementation issues that might become more relevant due to climate change considerations: future storm intensification and sea level rise (SLR). For storm intensification, the use of the surrogate model for prediction extrapolation is examined. Tuning of the surrogate model characteristics using cross-validation techniques and modification of the tuning to prioritize storms with specific characteristics are proposed, whereas an augmentation of the database with new/additional storms is also considered. With respect to SLR, the recently developed database for the US Army Corps of Engineers' North Atlantic Comprehensive Coastal Study is exploited to demonstrate how surrogate modeling can support predictions that include SLR considerations.},

abstract = {The Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools Interagency Task Force, jointly convened by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the National Ocean Council (NOC), began its work in August 2015. The Task Force has focused its efforts on three primary tasks: 1) updating scenarios of global mean sea level (GMSL) rise, 2) integrating the global scenarios with regional factors contributing to sea level change for the entire U.S. coastline, and 3) incorporating these regionally appropriate scenarios within coastal risk management tools and capabilities deployed by individual agencies in support of the needs of specific stakeholder groups and user communities. This technical report focuses on the first two of these tasks and reports on the production of gridded relative sea level (RSL, which includes both ocean-level change and vertical land motion) projections for the United States associated with an updated set of GMSL scenarios. In addition to supporting the longer-term Task Force effort, this new product will be an important input into the USGCRP Sustained Assessment process and upcoming Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA4) due in 2018. This report also serves as a key technical input into the in-progress USGCRP Climate Science Special Report (CSSR). In order to bound the set of GMSL rise scenarios for year 2100, we assessed the most up-to-date scientific literature on scientifically supported upper-end GMSL projections, including recent observational and modeling literature related to the potential for rapid ice melt in Greenland and Antarctica. The projections and results presented in several peer-reviewed publications provide evidence to support a physically plausible GMSL rise in the range of 2.0 meters (m) to 2.7 m, and recent results regarding Antarctic ice-sheet instability indicate that such outcomes may be more likely than previously thought. To ensure consistency with these recent updates to the peer-reviewed scientific literature, we recommend a revised ‘extreme' upper-bound scenario for GMSL rise of 2.5 m by the year 2100, which is 0.5 m higher than the upper bound scenario from Parris et al. (2012) employed by the Third NCA (NCA3). In addition, after consideration of tide gauge and altimeter-based estimates of the rates of GMSL change over the past quarter-century and of recent modeling of future low-end projections of GMSL rise, we revise Parris et al. (2012)'s estimate of the lower bound upward by 0.1 m to 0.3 m by the year 2100. This report articulates the linkages between scenario-based and probabilistic projections of future sea levels for coastal-risk planning, management of long-lived critical infrastructure, mission readiness, and other purposes. The probabilistic projections discussed in this report recognize the inherent dependency (conditionality) of future GMSL rise on future greenhouse-gas emissions and associated ocean-atmosphere warming. In recognition of the different time horizons of relevance to different decision contexts, as well as the long-term GMSL rise commitment (lagged GMSL response) from on-going increases in ocean-atmosphere warming, GMSL rise and associated RSL change are quantified from the year 2000 through the year 2200 (on a decadal basis to 2100 and with lower temporal frequency between 2100 and 2200). The 0.3 m-2.5 m GMSL range for 2100 is discretized by 0.5-m increments and aligned with emissions-based, conditional probabilistic storylines and global model projections into six GMSL rise scenarios: a Low, Intermediate-Low, Intermediate, Intermediate-High, High and Extreme, which correspond to GMSL rise of 0.3 m, 0.5 m, 1.0 m, 1.5 m, 2.0 m and 2.5 m, respectively. These GMSL rise scenarios are used to derive regional RSL responses on a 1-degree grid covering the coastlines of the U.S. mainland, Alaska, Hawaii, the Caribbean, and the Pacific island territories, as well as at the precise locations of tide gauges along these coastlines. These scenario-based RSL values fill a major gap in climate information needed to vii support a wide range of assessment, planning, and decision-making processes. GMSL was adjusted to account for key factors important at regional scales, including: 1) shifts in oceanographic factors such as circulation patterns; 2) changes in the Earth's gravitational field and rotation, and the flexure of the crust and upper mantle, due to melting of land-based ice; and 3) vertical land movement (VLM; subsidence or uplift) due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA, which also changes Earth's gravitational field and rotation, as well as the overall shape of the ocean basin), sediment compaction, groundwater and fossil fuel withdrawals, and other nonclimatic factors. Key findings include: ● Along regions of the Northeast Atlantic (Virginia coast and northward) and the western Gulf of Mexico coasts, RSL rise is projected to be greater than the global average for almost all future GMSL rise scenarios (e.g., 0.3-0.5 m or more RSL rise by the year 2100 than GMSL rise under the Intermediate scenario). ● Along much of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska coasts, RSL is projected to be less than the global average under the Low-to-Intermediate scenarios (e.g., 0.1-1 m or less RSL rise by the year 2100 than GMSL rise under the Intermediate scenario). ● Along almost all U.S. coasts outside Alaska, RSL is projected to be higher than the global average under the Intermediate-High, High and Extreme scenarios (e.g., 0.3-1 m or more RSL rise by the year 2100 than GMSL rise under the High scenario). Finally, the consequences of rising RSL are presented in terms of how the frequency of moderate-level flooding associated with a NOAA coastal/lakeshore flood warning of a serious risk to life and property may change in the future under the sea level scenarios. The elevation threshold used to classify such events by NOAA on their tide gauges varies along the U.S. coastline, but in general it is about 0.8 m (2.6 feet) above the highest average tide and locally has a 20{\%} annual chance of occurrence. For example, using the flood-frequency definition, we find at most locations examined (90 cities along the U.S. coastline outside of Alaska) that with only about 0.35 m ({\textless}14 inches) of local RSL rise, annual frequencies of such disruptive/damaging flooding will increase 25-fold by or about (±5 years) 2080, 2060, 2040 and 2030 under the Low, Intermediate-Low, Intermediate and Intermediate High subset of scenarios, respectively.},

@article{Takagi2016,
abstract = {Even though the maximum wind radius (Rmax) is an important parameter in determining the intensity and size of tropical cyclones, it has been overlooked in previous storm surge studies. This study reviews the existing estimation methods for Rmax based on central pressure or maximum wind speed. These over-or underestimate Rmax because of substantial variations in the data, although an average radius can be estimated with moderate accuracy. As an alternative, we propose an Rmax estimation method based on the radius of the 50 kt wind (R50). Data obtained by a meteorological station network in the Japanese archipelago during the passage of strong typhoons, together with the JMA typhoon best track data for 1990-2013, enabled us to derive the following simple equation, Rmax =0.23 R50. Application to a recent strong typhoon, the 2015 Typhoon Goni, confirms that the equation provides a good estimation of Rmax, particularly when the central pressure became considerably low. Although this new method substantially improves the estimation of Rmax compared to the existing models, estimation errors are unavoidable because of fundamental uncertainties regarding the typhoon's structure or insufficient number of available typhoon data. In fact, a numerical simulation for the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan as well as 2015 Typhoon Goni demonstrates a substantial difference in the storm surge height for different Rmax. Therefore, the variability of Rmax should be taken into account in storm surge simulations (e.g., Rmax =0.15 R50-0.35 R50), independently of the model used, to minimize the risk of over-or underestimating storm surges. The proposed method is expected to increase the predictability of major storm surges and to contribute to disaster risk management, particularly in the western North Pacific, including countries such as Japan, China, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Vietnam.},

abstract = {Numerical solution of the two-dimensional shallow water equations is achieved by coupling the finite element method in space with finite difference time stepping schemes. Solutions obtained with an efficient leapfrog model are found to contain severe short-wavelength oscillations in space when compared to analytic solutions. An alternative semi-implicit formulation in the time domain, which retains most of the economical advantages of the leapfrog scheme is developed and tested. A significant reduction in the mode-to-node oscillations and improved agreement with analytical solutions are obtained. Both linear triangles and quadratic isoparametric quadrilaterals are examined. Emphasis is on the numerical behavior of the schemes tested and a comparison with a field case is not attempted. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

This map shows relations among the distributions of depth, sea floor area, and sea floor age that do not fit the predictions of deterministic models of subsidence due to lithosphere cooling but may be explained by a stochastic model in which randomly distributed reheating events warm the lithosphere and raise the ocean floor.},

It is pointed out that the particular attraction of that mechanism lay in its ability to generalize the class of asymmetric, or 'upwinded' finite-difference schemes, in a simple and natural way. In the present investigation, Roe's claim is reviewed and revised in the light of two and a half years of additional experience. A fairly general form of the flux difference splitting concept, applicable to one-dimensional conservation laws, is discussed. Attention is given to the 'monotone' second-order scheme, the designing of the B-functions, and problems regarding satisfying entropy.},

abstract = {AbstractInternal tides are internal gravity waves generated in stratified waters by the interaction of barotropic tidal currents with variable bottom topography. They play a role in dissipating tidal energy and lead to mixing in the deep ocean. Key dimensionless parameters governing their generation include the tidal excursion compared with the scale of the topography, the bottom slope compared with the angle at which rays of internal waves of tidal frequency propagate, and the height of the topography compared with the depth of the ocean. Recent theoretical developments for parts of this parameter space particularly relevant to the deep ocean show that most of the energy flux is associated with low modes that propagate away from the generation region. For isolated features this energy flux is not strongly dependent on the bottom slope. Intense beams of internal tidal energy are expected near “critical slopes," bottom slopes equal to the ray slope, and lead to local mixing.},

abstract = {In coastal regions, floods can arise through a combination of multiple drivers, including direct surface runoff , river 15 discharge, storm surge and waves. In this study, we analyse compound flood potential in Europe caused by these four main flooding sources using state-of-the-art databases with homogenous forcing (i.e., ERA5). First, we perform an analysis to assess the sensitivity of the compound flooding potential to several factors: 1) sampling method; 2) time window to select the concurrent event of the conditioned driver; 3) dependence metrics; 4) wave-driven sea level definition. We observe higher correlation coefficients using annual maxima than peaks over threshold. Regarding the other factors, our results show similar 20 spatial distributions of the compound flooding potential. Second, the dependence between the pairs of drivers using the Kendall's rank correlation coefficient and the joint occurrence are synthesized for coherent patterns of compound flooding potential using a clustering technique. This quantitative multi-driver assessment not only distinguishes where overall compound flooding potential is the highest, but also discriminates which driver combinations are more likely to contribute to compound flooding. We identify hotspots of compound flooding potential located along the southern coast of the North 25 Atlantic Ocean and the northern coast of the Mediterranean Sea.},

Three relatively coarse meshes with nearly identical boundaries are automatically produced by basing internal size guidelines on a localized truncation error analysis that was performed using results from a highly resolved mesh. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of model performance are made at 150 historical tidal stations. The coarsest mesh is shown to meet or exceed the overall accuracy of the other meshes, including a highly resolved mesh that has over six times as many computational points. The automated procedure quickly and easily produces a computationally efficient and accurate finite element mesh that is reproducible. In addition, the methodology is shown to have potential for assessing the importance and accuracy of and bathymetric details and evaluating historical hydrodynamic data.},

abstract = {The paper presents a detailed analysis of the flow over smoothly contoured constrictions in a plane channel. This configuration represents a generic case of a flow separating from a curved surface with well-defined flow conditions which makes it especially suited as benchmark case for computing separated flows. The hills constrict the channel by about one third of its height and are spaced at a distance of 9 hill heights. This setup follows the investigation of Fr{\"{o}}hlich et al. [Fr{\"{o}}hlich J, Mellen CP, Rodi W, Temmerman L, Leschziner MA. Highly resolved large-eddy simulation of separated flow in a channel with streamwise periodic constrictions. J Fluid Mech 2005;526:19-66] and complements it by numerical and experimental data over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. We present results predicted by direct numerical simulations (DNS) and highly resolved large-eddy simulations (LES) achieved by two completely independent codes. Furthermore, these numerical results are supported by new experimental data from PIV measurements. The configuration in the numerical study uses periodic boundary conditions in streamwise and spanwise direction. In the experimental setup periodicity is achieved by an array of 10 hills in streamwise direction and a large spanwise extent of the channel. The assumption of periodicity in the experiment is checked by the pressure drop between consecutive hill tops and PIV measurements. The focus of this study is twofold: (i) Numerical and experimental data are presented which can be referred to as reference data for this widely used standard test case. Physical peculiarities and new findings of the case under consideration are described and confirmed independently by different codes and experimental data. Mean velocity and pressure distributions, Reynolds stresses, anisotropy-invariant maps, and instantaneous quantities are shown. (ii) Extending previous studies the flow over periodic hills is investigated in the wide range of Reynolds numbers covering 100 ≤ Re ≤ 10, 595. Starting at very low Re the evolution and existence of physical phenomena such as a tiny recirculation region at the hill crest are documented. The limit to steady laminar flow as well as the transition to a fully turbulent flow stage are presented. For 700 ≤ Re ≤ 10, 595 turbulent statistics are analyzed in detail. Carefully, undertaken DNS and LES predictions as well as cross-checking between different numerical and experimental results build the framework for physical investigations on the flow behavior. New interesting features of the flow were found. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Researchers who study tsunami deposits share common ultimate goals of their work, which are to better assess the magnitude information of paleotsunamis and to contribute to the assessment of future tsunami risks. Numerical modeling of tsunami sediment transport is an important piece of interdisciplinary research that fills the gap between geological studies and practical utilization of tsunami deposits. Forward and inverse numerical models that address tsunami transport of sand and boulders have been developed over the last two decades. Forward models are capable of delineating the time evolution of tsunami hydrodynamics, sediment transport and the resulting morphological changes associated with erosion and deposition. Inverse models estimate tsunami characteristics, such as flow speed and depth, from deposits. Numerical modeling can be used not only to quantify paleotsunamis but also to enhance our understanding of tsunami sedimentology and hydrodynamics. To make progress towards the ultimate goal of improved tsunami risk assessment, development of an in-depth mutual understanding between modelers and geologists of the advantages, limitations and uncertainties in both numerical modeling and geological records is an important challenge.},

abstract = {The diurnal cycle of precipitation during the summer season over the contiguous United States is examined in eight distinct regions. These were identified using cluster analysis applied to the diurnal cycle characteristics at 2141 rainfall gauges over the 10-yr period 1991-2000. Application of the clustering technique provides a physically meaningful way of identifying regions for comparison of model results with observations. The diurnal cycle for each region is specified in terms of 1) total precipitation, 2) frequency of precipitation occurrence, and 3) intensity of precipitation per occurrence on an hourly basis averaged over the 10-yr period. The amplitude and phase of each element of the diurnal cycle was obtained from harmonic analysis and has been compared with the results of a 24-member multiphysics ensemble of simulations produced by the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) Model on a region-by-region basis. Three cumulus schemes, two radiation schemes, two microphysics schemes, and two planetary boundary layer schemes were included in the ensemble. Simulations of total precipitation showed reasonable agreement with observations in regions where the diurnal cycle is directly influenced by solar radiation, (e.g., the U.S. Southeast), but they were less successful in regions where other factors influence the diurnal cycle (e.g., the central United States). The diurnal cycle of precipitation frequency and intensity showed substantial biases in the simulations of all eight regions, namely, overestimation of occurrences and underestimation of intensities. Simulations were sensitive to the cumulus and radiation schemes but were largely insensitive to either microphysics or planetary boundary layer schemes.},

abstract = {The Hikurangi subduction margin, where the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the North Island of New Zealand, poses a major seismic and tsunami hazard to the New Zealand region, but its seismic and tsunami potential is largely unknown because of New Zealand's short ({\textless} 170 years) historical record of seismicity. This article discusses the implications of results from GPS, paleoseismology, and tsunami modeling studies for understanding Hikurangi subduction earthquake and tsunami potential. Paleoseismic and geodetic data indicate that earthquakes of MW 8.0 and larger are certainly plausible at the Hikurangi margin. Paleoseismic evidence for large megathrust earthquakes beneath Hawke Bay in central Hikurangi demonstrates that large seismic slip may occur within an area that currently slips in episodic slow slip events. This result has important implications for seismic hazards at subduction margins elsewhere. Strong similarities between the subduction zones of the Hikurangi margin and the Japan Trench suggest that a giant MW 9.0 earthquake similar to the 2011 Tōhoku-Oki earthquake may be possible for the Hikurangi margin. Such an event would generate a large tsunami that would inundate much of the east coast of the North Island. Understanding of the earthquake potential of the Hikurangi megathrust is only in its infancy, and we recommend a number of studies to increase knowledge. {\textcopyright} 2014 by The Oceanography Society.

abstract = {The performance of two methods for quantifying whitecapping dissipation incorporated in the Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) wave model is evaluated for waves generated along and off the US east coast under energetic winter storms with a predominantly westerly wind. Parameterizing the whitecapping effect can be done using the Komen-type schemes, which are based on mean spectral parameters, or the saturation-based (SB) approach of van der Westhuysen (2007), which is based on local wave parameters and the saturation level concept of the wave spectrum (we use "Komen" and "Westhuysen" to denote these two approaches). Observations of wave parameters and frequency spectra at four National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys are used to evaluate simulation results. Model-data comparisons show that when using the default parameters in SWAN, both Komen and Westhuysen methods underestimate wave height. Simulations of mean wave period using the Komen method agree with observations, but those using the Westhuysen method are substantially lower. Examination of source terms shows that the Westhuysen method underestimates the total energy transferred into the wave action equations, especially in the lower frequency bands that contain higher spectral energy. Several causes for this underestimation are identified. The primary reason is the difference between the wave growth conditions along the east coast during winter storms and the conditions used for the original whitecapping formula calibration. In addition, some deficiencies in simulation results are caused along the coast by the "slanting fetch" effect that adds low-frequency components to the 2-D wave spectra. These components cannot be simulated partly or entirely by available source terms (wind input, whitecapping, and quadruplet) in models and their interaction. Further, the effect of boundary layer instability that is not considered in the Komen and Westhuysen whitecapping wind input formulas may cause additional underestimation.},

abstract = {The unstructured grid finite volume coastal ocean model (FVCOM) system has been expanded to include nonhydrostatic dynamics. This addition uses the factional step method with both split mode explicit and semi-implicit schemes. The unstructured grid finite volume method, combined with a correction of the final free surface from its intermediate value with inclusion of nonhydrostatic effects, efficiently reduces numerical damping and thus ensures second-order accuracy of the solutions with local/global volume conservation. Numerical experiments have been made to fully validate the nonhydrostatic FVCOM, including surface standing and solitary waves in idealized flat- and sloping-bottomed channels in homogeneous conditions, the density adjustment problem for lock exchange flow in a flat-bottomed channel, and two-layer internal solitary wave breaking on a sloping shelf. The model results agree well with the relevant analytical solutions and laboratory data. These validation experiments demonstrate that the nonhydrostatic FVCOM is capable of resolving complex nonhydrostatic dynamics in coastal and estuarine regions.},

abstract = {Bedforms such as dunes and ripples are ubiquitous in rivers and coastal seas, and commonly described as triangular shapes from which height and length are calculated to estimate hydrodynamic and sediment dynamic parameters. Natural bedforms, however, present a far more complicated morphology; the difference between natural bedform shape and the often assumed triangular shape is usually neglected, and how this may affect the flow is unknown. This study investigates the shapes of natural bedforms and how they influence flow and shear stress, based on four datasets extracted from earlier studies on two rivers (the Rio Paran{\'{a}} in Argentina, and the Lower Rhine in The Netherlands). The most commonly occurring morphological elements are a sinusoidal stoss side made of one segment and a lee side made of two segments, a gently sloping upper lee side and a relatively steep (6 to 21°) slip face. A non-hydrostatic numerical model, set up using Delft3D, served to simulate the flow over fixed bedforms with various morphologies derived from the identified morphological elements. Both shear stress and turbulence increase with increasing slip face angle and are only marginally affected by the dimensions and positions of the upper and lower lee side. The average slip face angle determined from the bed profiles is 14°, over which there is no permanent flow separation. Shear stress and turbulence above natural bedforms are higher than above a flat bed but much lower than over the often assumed 30° lee side angle.},

abstract = {This paper describes the formulation, verification, and validation of a depth-integrated, non-hydrostatic model with a semi-implicit, finite difference scheme. The formulation builds on the nonlinear shallow-water equations and utilizes a non-hydrostatic pressure term to describe weakly dispersive waves. A momentumconserved advection scheme enables modeling of breaking waves without the aid of analytical solutions for bore approximation or empirical equations for energy dissipation. An upwind scheme extrapolates the free-surface elevation instead of the flow depth to provide the flux in the momentum and continuity equations. This greatly improves the model stability, which is essential for computation of energetic breaking waves and run-up. The computed results show very good agreement with laboratory data for wave propagation, transformation, breaking, and run-up. Since the numerical scheme to the momentum and continuity equations remains explicit, the implicit non-hydrostatic solution is directly applicable to existing nonlinear shallow-water models.

abstract = {Rising seas coupled with ever increasing coastal populations present the potential for significant social and economic loss in the 21st century. Relatively short records of the full multidimensional space contributing to total water level coastal flooding events (astronomic tides, sea level anomalies, storm surges, wave run-up, etc.) result in historical observations of only a small fraction of the possible range of conditions that could produce severe flooding. The Time-varying Emulator for Short- and Long-Term analysis of coastal flood hazard potential is presented here as a methodology capable of producing new iterations of the sea-state parameters associated with the present-day Pacific Ocean climate to simulate many synthetic extreme compound events. The emulator utilizes weather typing of fundamental climate drivers (sea surface temperatures, sea level pressures, etc.) to reduce complexity and produces new daily synoptic weather chronologies with an auto-regressive logistic model accounting for conditional dependencies on the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation, the Madden-Julian Oscillation, seasonality, and the prior two days of weather progression. Joint probabilities of sea-state parameters unique to simulated weather patterns are used to create new time series of the hypothetical components contributing to synthetic total water levels (swells from multiple directions coupled with water levels due to wind setup, temperature anomalies, and tides). The Time-varying Emulator for Short- and Long-Term analysis of coastal flood hazard potential reveals the importance of considering the multivariate nature of extreme coastal flooding, while progressing the ability to incorporate large-scale climate variability into site specific studies assessing hazards within the context of predicted climate change in the 21st century.},

@article{Donahue2016,
abstract = {The pressure-Poisson Boussinesq models of Donahue et al. (2014) are extended to the surf zone and tested at O ($\mu$2) and O ($\mu$4). This approach resembles a classic Boussinesq-type model with the exception that the dispersive accuracy is obtained through consideration of a Boussinesq-scaled Green–Naghdi type approximation to the nonhydrostatic pressure profile and solved as a solution to the pressure-Poisson equation. The result is a Boussinesq-type model that is similar to the shallow water equations (SWE) with a nonhydrostatic pressure term. This allows for the straightforward modification of established SWE solvers to turn them into fully resolved nearshore models with very little structural change to the underlying SWE model and without the need to solve mixed space/time derivatives. The excellent hyperbolic properties of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element method are used to solve all terms except pressure and a simple yet accurate finite difference approach is used to solve the elliptic pressure equations. A straightforward numerics based wave breaking algorithm is employed and wave runup is captured using a globally mass conservative wetting/drying algorithm specifically designed for DG finite element methods. The result is a full surf-zone model capable of capturing the propagation of waves offshore, the breaking of waves near shore and full wave runup. The model is verified and validated using analytical and experimental results for both fully nonlinear O ($\mu$2) and weakly nonlinear O ($\mu$4)implementations.},

abstract = {Systemic discrepancies between observed and modeled tsunami wave speeds were previously identified for two recent major tsunamis: the 2010 Maule and 2011 Tohoku events. To account for these discrepancies, we developed a numerical tsunami propagation code solving the shallow water equation and including the effects of elastic loading of the seafloor by the tsunami as well as a linear density profile in the seawater column. We show here that both effects are important to explain the commonly observed difference between observations and simulations. We conclude that the density variation in the seawater column affects the wave speed without changing the waveform, whereas the loading effect has an effect on the wave speed and the waveform showing a negative phase before the main arrival due to the depression of the seafloor surrounding the tsunami wave the combination of both effects is needed to achieve a better match between observations and simulations. Key Points There is a better agreement between observation and modeling The density stratification affects only traveltime The elastic loading affects traveltime and changes the wave form {\textcopyright} 2014.

abstract = {Process-based models have been widely used for storm surge predictions, but their high computational demand is a major drawback in some applications such as rapid forecasting. Few efforts have been made to employ previous databases of synthetic/real storms and provide more efficient surge predictions (e.g. using storm similarity of an individual storm to those in the database). Here, we develop an alternative efficient and robust artificial intelligent model, which predicts the peak storm surge using the tropical storm parameters: central pressure, radius to maximum winds, forward velocity, and storm track. The US Army Corp of Engineers, North Atlantic Comprehensive Coastal Study, has recently performed numerical simulations of 1050 synthetic tropical storms, which statistically represent tropical storms, using a coupled high resolution wave–surge modeling system for the east coast of the US, from Cape Hatteras to the Canadian border. This study has provided an unprecedented dataset which can be used to train artificial intelligence models for surge prediction in those areas. While numerical simulation of a storm surge at this scale and resolution (over 6 million elements scaling from 20 m to more than 100 km) is extremely expensive, the artificial intelligence takes the advantage of the previous simulations, and effectively learns the relationship between storm parameters representing storm forcing and surge. The artificial neural network method which was used for this study, was shown to outperform support vector machine for extreme storms. ANN model, which is based on a neurobiological analogy, can be conveniently developed, retrained by new data, and is nonparametric. The AI model, which was developed for Rhode Island, was validated using a set of randomly selected synthetic storms as well as real tropical storms in this region. The model performance was found satisfactory with root-mean-square error of {\textless}35 cm for observed and synthetic storms. It was also shown that it is not possible to develop a reliable artificial intelligence model for this region using a limited number of data (e.g. 200 storms), which is usually available in historical records.},

In this work, large eddy simulations with an actuator line model are used to study the wake of the NREL 5 MW reference turbine mounted on the OC3-UMaine spar and OC4-DeepCwind semi-submersible platforms. The simulations are carried out in the Simulator fOr Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA) coupled with OpenFAST for the platform and turbine motion. The wake location, deficit, and turbulence levels are compared for the two floating platforms and equivalent fixed-turbine cases. The effects of neutral versus stable atmospheric conditions are also compared. Most notably, floating-turbine wakes are deflected upwards compared to fixed-turbine wakes, because of mean platform pitch. The spar wake deflects upwards more than the semi-submersible, while the stable atmosphere increases this vertical deflection compared to the neutral. The time-varying rotor motions do not significantly affect the mid-to-far wake, though the stable atmosphere shows larger fixed-floating differences in horizontal wake fluctuations.},

abstract = {A new formulation of the pair of Boussinesq-class equations for modelling the propagation of three-dimensional nonlinear dispersive long water waves is presented. This set of model equations permits spatial and temporal variations of the bottom topography. Further, the two resultant equations may be combined into a single equation through the introduction of an irrotational layer-mean velocity. An exact permanent-form solution is derived for the combined equation, which is still of the Boussinesq-class and includes reflection. This solution for the surface height is found to describe a slightly wider wave than the permanent form solution to the uni-directional Korteweg-deVries Equation. A numerical scheme using an implicit finite-difference method is developed to solve the combined equation for propagation over fixed sloping bottom topography. The scheme is tested for various grid sizes using the permanent-form solution, and an oscillatory tail is seen to develop as a result of insufficient mesh refinement. Several cases of wave propagation over a straight sloping ramp onto a shelf are solved using the permanent-form solution as initial conditions and the results are found to be in good agreement with previous results obtained by using either the Boussinesq dual-equation set or the single Korteweg-deVries equation. The combined equation is used to solve the related problem in two horizontal dimensions of a wave propagating in a channel having a curved-ramp bottom topography. Depending on the specific topography, focussing or defocussing occurs and the crest is selectively amplified. Indications of cross-channel oscillation are presented. Linear, nondispersive theory is used to solve a case with identical topographical features and initial condition. The solutions using the simplified theory are found to be considerably different from the results for nonlinear, dispersive theory with respect to the overall three-dimensional wave shape as well as in the areas of crest amplification, soliton formation and cross-channel effects.},

@article{Fortunato2017,
abstract = {On February 15, 1941, a storm caused one of the major natural disasters in the Iberian Peninsula in the past century. The storm made landfall in the north of Portugal, leading to a large surge in the Tagus estuary. Adverse meteorological conditions combined with a high spring tide led to extensive flooding of dry land, causing severe damage and casualties. A suite of regional and local scale models is developed to analyze the event and the relative contributions of the different forcing agents to the extreme water levels. Quantitative and qualitative validations show that the models adequately reproduce this type of events. The models are then used to assess the inundation in the upstream reaches of the estuary where extensive agricultural lands are protected by dikes. Results show that over 25 km2 could be inundated today, a value that would increase threefold for a sea level rise of 0.5 m. Then, the relative importance of the different forcing mechanisms on the extreme water levels is investigated through numerical experiments. It is shown that the regional surge and the setup induced by swell are the two main drivers of the inundation. In particular, the modulation of the wave setup by tides induces a semi-diurnal signal which is amplified by resonance inside the estuary.},

abstract = {In this paper, a moving boundary technique is developed to investigate wave runup and rundown with depth-integrated equations. Highly nonlinear and weakly dispersive equations are solved using a high-order finite difference scheme. An eddy viscosity model is adopted for wave breaking so as to investigate breaking wave runup. The moving boundary technique utilizes linear extrapolation through the wet–dry boundary and into the dry region. Nonbreaking and breaking solitary wave runup is accurately predicted by the proposed model, yielding a validation of both the wave breaking parameterization and the moving boundary technique. Two-dimensional wave runup in a parabolic basin and around a conical island is investigated, and agreement with published data is excellent. Finally, the propagation and runup of a solitary wave in a trapezoidal channel is examined.},

abstract = {The sediment transport model SEDTRANS has been significantly upgraded based on new advances in both cohesive and non-cohesive sediment transport studies. For given input data of wave, current, and seabed conditions, the model applies the combined wave-current bottom boundary layer theories to derive the near-bed velocity profile and bed shear stresses, and then calculates sediment transport for currents only or combined waves and currents over either cohesive or non-cohesive sediments. Critical shear stresses for various sediment transport modes tested for combined waves and currents are adopted in SEDTRANS96. An explicit combined-flow ripple predictor is included in the model to provide time-dependent bed roughness prediction. SEDTRANS96 also predicts the vertical profiles of velocity and suspended sediment concentration and their product is integrated through depth to derive the suspended-load transport rate. More rigorous calibration of the model using measured sediment transport rates over fine and medium sands shows that the difference between the predicted and measured transport rates has been reduced from more than one order of magnitude to less than a factor of five. The proposed new cohesive sediment algorithm separates cohesive sediment transport into depositional, stable and erosional states. The applied shear stress, erosion/deposition time duration and the down-core profile of the critical shear stress for erosion are numerically integrated to predict the final erosion or deposition rate, suspension concentration and transport rate for cohesive sediment. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The baroclinic response of tide and tidal currents in the Yellow and East China Seas is investigated using a two-layer numerical model. Seasonal variability in the M2 tide, especially the smaller summer amplitudes prevailing along the Korea/Tsushima Strait [Kang et al., 1995], is investigated by a series of numerical experiments with varying degrees of stratification specific to winter and summer. Model results show that the summer amplitudes of the M2 tide around the southwestern tip of the Korean peninsula and Korea/Tsusima Strait decrease, with a peak decrease of about 14 cm off the southwestern tip of the Korean peninsula, while the summer amplitudes in other coastal regions tend to increase. This seasonal variability generally coincides with the observations. These models results indicate that seasonal stratification has several noticeable effects on the tides, including varying degrees of current shear, varying frictional dissipation, and varying barotropic energy flux. In particular, it drives complicated seasonal variability in the M2 tide, with a peak amplitude modulation of nearly 5{\%} off the southwestern tip of the Korean peninsula. The seasonal variation of barotropic M2 energy flux through the eastern entrance of the Yellow Sea is thought to induce the corresponding variability in the M2 amplitude in the Korea/Tsusima Strait, with smaller amplitudes found in the summer.},

It draws on research using idealized models and complex climate simulations, to evaluate what is known and unknown about these future changes. Recent Findings: There are interacting processes that contribute to the uncertainties in future extratropical cyclone changes, e.g., changes in the horizontal and vertical structure of the atmosphere and increasing moisture content due to rising temperatures. Summary: While precipitation intensity will most likely increase, along with associated increased latent heating, it is unclear to what extent and for which particular climate conditions this will feedback to increase the intensity of the cyclones. Future research could focus on bridging the gap between idealized models and complex climate models, as well as better understanding of the regional impacts of future changes in extratropical cyclones.},

abstract = {Turbulent flow over strongly forced steep steady and unsteady waves is simulated using large-eddy simulation (LES) with time t and space x varying wave height h(x, t) imposed as a lower boundary condition. With steady waves, h(x, t) is based on measurements of incipient and active breaking waves collected in a wind-wave flume, while a numerical wave code is used to generate an unsteady evolving wave packet (group). Highly intermittent airflow separation is found in the simulations, and the results suggest separation near a wave crest occurs prior to the onset of wave breaking. The form (pressure) drag is most sensitive to the wave slope, and the form drag can contribute as much as 74{\%} to the total stress. Wind and scalar profiles from the LES display log-linear variations above the wave surface; the LES wind profiles are in good agreement with the measurements. The momentum roughness increases as the water surface changes from wind ripples to incipient breaking to active breaking. However, the scalar roughness decreases as the wave surface becomes rougher. This highlights major differences in momentum and scalar transport over a rough wavy surface. For a rapidly evolving, strongly forced wave group, the form drag is highly correlated with the wave slope, and intermittent separation is found early in the packet evolution when the local wave slope -∂h/∂x(x, t) ≥ 0.22. The packet root-mean-square wave slope is 0.084, but the form drag fraction is 2.4 times larger than a comparably forced steady wave. Thus, a passing wave group can induce unsteadiness in the wind stress.},

@article{Begmohammadi2021,
abstract = {Subgrid modeling to account for unresolved topography within the context of shallow water equations relies on the use of coarse grids for computational efficiency. However, excessively coarse grids can lead to artificial cross flows between hydrologically disconnected areas separated by physical barriers smaller than the grid size. An approach based on introducing cell and edge clones, consisting of connected groups of pixels in each cell, is able to systematically remove such artificial cross flows. Such an approach considers that the subgrid barriers permanently divide flow among clones and effectively restrict flow to a predetermined path. In this work, a simple algorithm, along with the use of an overtopping formula, is proposed to extend the clone approach to a scenario in which clones are allowed to be further split and merged as needed, depending on the surface elevation during a given runtime. The algorithm is intended for accommodating the possibility of the subgrid barriers being inundated and no-longer dividing the flow during an extreme event. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through a series of idealized and more realistic test cases, showing considerable improvements over existing methodologies.},

abstract = {Parameterizations for physical processes in weather and climate models are computationally expensive. We use model output from a set of simulations performed using the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model to train deep neural networks and evaluate whether trained models can provide an accurate alternative to the physics-based parameterizations. Specifically, we develop an emulator using deep neural networks for a planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization in the WRF model. PBL parameterizations are commonly used in atmospheric models to represent the diurnal variation of the formation and collapse of the atmospheric boundary layer {\&}ndash; the lowest part of the atmosphere. The dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer, mixing and turbulence within the boundary layer, velocity, temperature, and humidity profiles are all critical for determining many of the physical processes in the atmosphere. PBL parameterizations are used to represent these processes that are usually unresolved in a typical numerical weather model that operates at horizontal spatial scales in the tens of kilometers. We demonstrate that a domain-aware deep neural network, which takes account of underlying domain structure that are locality specific (e.g., terrain, spatial dependence vertically), can successfully simulate the vertical profiles within the boundary layer of velocities, temperature, and water vapor over the entire diurnal cycle. We then assess the spatial transferability of the domain-aware neural networks by using a trained model from one location to nearby locations. Results show that a single trained model from a location over the midwestern United States produces predictions of wind components, temperature, and water vapor profiles over the entire diurnal cycle and all nearby locations with errors less than a few percent when compared with the WRF simulations used as the training dataset.},

abstract = {Abstract An unstructured grid, finite-volume, three-dimensional (3D) primitive equation ocean model has been developed for the study of coastal oceanic and estuarine circulation. The model consists of momentum, continuity, temperature, salinity, and density equations and is closed physically and mathematically using the Mellor and Yamada level-2.5 turbulent closure submodel. The irregular bottom slope is represented using a $\sigma$-coordinate transformation, and the horizontal grids comprise unstructured triangular cells. The finite-volume method (FVM) used in this model combines the advantages of a finite-element method (FEM) for geometric flexibility and a finite-difference method (FDM) for simple discrete computation. Currents, temperature, and salinity in the model are computed in the integral form of the equations, which provides a better representation of the conservative laws for mass, momentum, and heat in the coastal region with complex geometry. The model was applied to the Bohai Sea, a semienclosed coastal ocean, and the Satilla River, a Georgia estuary characterized by numerous tidal creeks and inlets. Compared with the results obtained from the finite-difference model (ECOM-si), the new model produces a better simulation of tidal elevations and residual currents, especially around islands and tidal creeks. Given the same initial distribution of temperature in the Bohai Sea, the FVCOM and ECOM-si models show similar distributions of temperature and stratified tidal rectified flow in the interior region away from the coast and islands, but FVCOM appears to provide a better simulation of temperature and currents around the islands, barriers, and inlets with complex topography.},

The 95{\%} confidence intervals of the results of the analysis have been systematically estimated. The numerical and statistical methods applied to produce these numbers are presented for three stations as an illustration. One example of application of this new dataset and its error bars is the selection of a tidal constant set, which is useful for validating and comparing the long-period tide models.

Under the assumption of the law of the wall, the bed roughness is estimated by plotting time series of mean velocities measured at a lower level against those at an upper level. A simple criterion is also derived to censor the velocity data when only some of the data are of logarithmic distribution. This new method is then applied to estimate the bed roughness at three study sites (Site-1, 2, 5) in Moreton Bay, one of the semi-enclosed largest bays in Australia. The mean velocities were measured for 10min every 30min at 34 and 100cm above the seabed at the northern entrance (h=16m, $\phi$50=0.2mm, Site-1), the bay centre (h=15m, mud, Site-2) and Deception Bay (h=6m, mud, Site-5) in the Bay. Based on the mean velocities measured for 5 days, the bed roughness is estimated as ks=0.07, 1.92 and 0.52cm at Site-1, 2 and 5, and correspondingly, the drag coefficient is CD=1.42×10-3, 2.96×10−3 and 2.13×10−3.},

Here we show that the seasonal variations of the tidal constants are significant in the major part of the domain. Month to month changes of the tidal phases can reach 180 degrees due to changes in the number and positions of the amphidromic points, whereas the amplitude variations are especially large in the near resonant basins. We also show that the tidal seasonality has undergone dramatic changes in the past decades due the decaying extent of the Arctic sea ice.

abstract = {The interplay between wind waves and currents in the coastal zone of the southern North Sea along with the resulting changes in the salinity distribution are quantified using simulations with the unstructured-grid ocean model SCHISM coupled with the wind wave model WWM III. Several sensitivity runs, which are carried out to estimate the individual contributions of different physical mechanisms and forcing, demonstrated that the density gradients in the coastal zone reduce tidal current by 18{\%}, whereas the wind waves enhance the circulation in some cases. The latter happens when along-shore wind speed approaches ∼10 m s−1 resulting in long-shore currents following the western Dutch coast and the German Wadden Sea islands. The wave-induced transport of salt leads to changes in the horizontal salinity distribution. These are most pronounced in front of barrier islands where coherent patterns caused by the coupling between tides, surface drift, and wind waves reveal salinity changes up to 0.5. The weak stratification of salinity in the coastal zone is mostly destroyed by wind waves. Thus, effects created by wind waves tend to substantially modify the estuarine circulation. An explanation of these important processes in the coastal zone has been given based on an analysis of the ratio between significant wave height and tidal range. This control-parameter, which is relatively small under mild weather conditions, can exceed unity under strong wind conditions in the coastal zone, thus mixing due to waves becomes dominant. The effect of fresh water fluxes from subterranean estuaries is relatively small and confined only in the vicinity of corresponding sources.},

abstract = {The potential for storm surge to cause extensive property damage and loss of life has increased urgency to more accurately predict coastal flooding associated with landfalling tropical cyclones. This work investigates the sensitivity of coastal inundation from storm tide (surge + tide) to four hurricane parameters-track, intensity, size, and translation speed-and the sensitivity of inundation forecasts to errors in forecasts of those parameters. An ensemble of storm tide simulations is generated for three storms in the Gulf of Mexico, by driving a storm surge model with best track data and systematically generated perturbations of storm parameters from the best track. The spread of the storm perturbations is compared to average errors in recent operational hurricane forecasts, allowing sensitivity results to be interpreted in terms of practical predictability of coastal inundation at different lead times. Two types of inundation metrics are evaluated: point-based statistics and spatially integrated volumes. The practical predictability of surge inundation is found to be limited foremost by current errors in hurricane track forecasts, followed by intensity errors, then speed errors. Errors in storm size can also play an important role in limiting surge predictability at short lead times, due to observational uncertainty. Results show that given current mean errors in hurricane forecasts, location-specific surge inundation is predictable for as little as 12-24 h prior to landfall, less for small-sized storms. The results also indicate potential for increased surge predictability beyond 24 h for large storms by considering a storm-following, volume-integrated metric of inundation.},

abstract = {The impact of mean sea level rise (SLR) on extreme water levels is investigated using a numerical model that covers the entire North Sea, but has its highest spatial resolution in the northern part of the German Bight. A 40-year hindcast covering the period 1970 to 2009 is conducted using observed mean sea level (MSL) changes, tides and atmospheric forcing as boundary conditions. The model reproduces the observed water levels well for this control period. A second 40-year run is then conducted considering the same atmospheric forcing but adding +0.54m to the MSL to explore the effects of sea level rise on storm surges in the investigation area. At most locations, the second model run leads to changes in the storm surge water levels that are significantly different from the changes in MSL alone. The largest increases of the order of 15cm (in addition to the MSL changes) occur in the shallow water areas of the Wadden Sea. These increases in storm surge water levels are caused by nonlinear changes in the tidal constituents which are spatially not coherent. The response of the tidal propagation to SLR is investigated based on the results from a tidal analysis of each individual event. These analyses point to an increase in the M2 amplitude and decrease in the amplitudes of frictional and overtides accompanied by less tidal wave energy dissipation. Attributed effects are changes in phase lags of individual constituents leading to a different tidal modulation, thus additionally increasing tidal water levels. Finally, we estimate how SLR affects return water levels in the northern part of the German Bight, with the result that relevant design water levels increase due to the non-linear relationship between SLR and changes in extremes.},

abstract = {Coastal communities are threatened by sea-level changes operating at various spatial scales; global to regional variations are associated with glacier and ice sheet loss and ocean thermal expansion, while smaller coastal-scale variations are also related to atmospheric surges, tides and waves. Here, using 23 years (1993–2015) of global coastal sea-level observations, we examine the contribution of these latter processes to long-term sea-level rise, which, to date, have been relatively less explored. It is found that wave contributions can strongly dampen or enhance the effects of thermal expansion and land ice loss on coastal water-level changes at interannual-to-multidecadal timescales. Along the US West Coast, for example, negative wave-induced trends dominate, leading to negative net water-level trends. Accurate estimates of past, present and future coastal sea-level rise therefore need to consider low-frequency contributions of wave set-up and swash.},

abstract = {The Joint-Probability Method (JPM) was adopted by federal agencies for critical post-Katrina determinations of hurricane surge frequencies. In standard JPM implementations, it is necessary to consider a very large number of combinations of storm parameters, and each such combination (or synthetic storm) requires the simulation of wind, waves, and surge. The tools used to model the wave and surge phenomena have improved greatly in recent years, but this improvement and the use of very large high-resolution grids have made the computations both time-consuming and expensive. In order to ease the computational burden, two independent approaches have been developed to reduce the number of storm surge simulations that are required. Both of these so-called JPM-OS (JPM-Optimal Sampling) methods seek to accurately cover the entire storm parameter space through optimum selection of a small number of parameter values so as to minimize the number of required storm simulations. Tests done for the Mississippi coast showed that the accuracy of the two methods is comparable to that of a full JPM analysis, with a reduction of an order of magnitude or more in the computational effort. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

A note published in this journal claimed that Weibull's 1939 estimator for sample probability has a unique status that invalidates all other estimators and renders invalid all of the developments of unbiased distribution-dependent estimators made since 1939. The note concluded that the use of distribution-dependent estimators should be abandoned and that many estimates of the weather-related risks should be reevaluated and the related building codes and other related regulations updated. This comment uses rigorous statistical proofs to make the diametrically opposite case: namely, that development of distribution-dependent estimators has resulted in an improvement in accuracy over the past half century and that no changes are required to the basis of weather-related building codes and regulations. These rigorous proofs are supplemented by sampling experiments that demonstrate their validity. This comment provides an introduction to the basic statistical concepts of the statistical modeling of extremes, including unbiased estimators for the model parameters. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

The early search for stable and accurate techniques was driven by the presence of spurious computational modes in sea level and/or velocity for most obvious choices of computational grids. Building on collective experiences, newer methods have overcome many of these earlier problems with spurious modes, advection instabilities, accuracy, and efficiency. Two classes of models are described here: the first solves a modified form of the governing equations (wave equation) with simple finite elements, and the other solves the primitive equations with finite elements that contain no spurious modes. The models are applied to case studies of tides around New Zealand, to advection controlled flows during a flood, and to tsunami generated by a submarine landslide on the continental shelf.

abstract = {A new semi-empirical storm surge prediction (SESSP) method is presented that computes tropical cyclone induced storm surge levels as a function of space and time for various storm and geometry input parameters. It distinguishes between five components that contribute to the total surge: the normal, parallel, radial, Ekman, and inverse barometer surge. The parallel surge (caused by shore-parallel gradients in the wind stress) and radial surge (resulting from wind set-up due to the inflow angle of cyclonic wind fields) have not been adequately reported upon before. The empirical relations are derived using the results of thousands of numerical model simulations in which synthetic storms are simulated at coasts with varying cross-shore topography. Non-linear fitting procedures are used to derive surge response functions (SRFs). The SESSP method reproduces peak surge levels within 10 percent of the values computed by the hydrodynamic model. This study showed variable surge response at different types of coast. On steep coasts, surge is dominated by the inverse barometer effect. Along intermediate and mild sloping coasts, the wind set-up has the greatest contribution to the peak surge. The Ekman surge (caused by the Coriolis effect) typically peaks several hours before landfall and can either have a positive or negative contribution to the peak surge. The radial surge becomes relatively more important on mild-sloping coasts. SESSP's computational efficiency allows for the execution of ensemble forecasts with thousands of synthetic storms along large stretches of coast.},

abstract = {A new real-time, event-triggered storm surge prediction system has been developed for the State of North Carolina to assist emergency managers, policy-makers and other government officials with evacuation planning, decision-making and resource deployment during tropical storm landfall and flood inundation events. The North Carolina Forecast System (NCFS) was designed and built to provide a rapid response assessment of hurricane threat, accomplished by driving a high-resolution, two-dimensional, depth-integrated version of the ADCIRC (Advanced Circulation) coastal ocean model with winds from a synthetic asymmetric gradient wind vortex. These parametric winds, calculated at exact finite-element mesh node locations and directly coupled to the ocean model at every time step, are generated from National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast advisories the moment they are inserted into the real-time weather data stream, maximizing the number of hours of forecast utility. Tidal harmonic constituents are prescribed at the open water boundaries and applied as tidal potentials in the interior of the ocean model domain. A directional surface roughness parameterization that modulates the wind speed at a given location based on the types of land cover encountered upwind, a forest canopy sheltering effect, and a spatially varying distribution of Manning's-n friction coefficient used for computing the bottom/channel bed friction are also included in the storm surge model. Comparisons of the simulated wind speeds and phases against their real meteorological counterparts, of model elevations against actual sea surface elevations measured by NOAA tide gauges along the NC coast, and of simulated depth-averaged current velocities against Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data, indicate that this new system produces remarkably realistic predictions of winds and storm surge. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Author(s) 2017. An algorithm for the generation of non-uniform, locally orthogonal staggered unstructured spheroidal grids is described. This technique is designed to generate very high-quality staggered Voronoi-Delaunay meshes appropriate for general circulation modelling on the sphere, including applications to atmospheric simulation, ocean-modelling and numerical weather prediction. Using a recently developed Frontal-Delaunay refinement technique, a method for the construction of high-quality unstructured spheroidal Delaunay triangulations is introduced. A locally orthogonal polygonal grid, derived from the associated Voronoi diagram, is computed as the staggered dual. It is shown that use of the Frontal-Delaunay refinement technique allows for the generation of very high-quality unstructured triangulations, satisfying a priori bounds on element size and shape. Grid quality is further improved through the application of hill-climbing-type optimisation techniques. Overall, the algorithm is shown to produce grids with very high element quality and smooth grading characteristics, while imposing relatively low computational expense. A selection of uniform and non-uniform spheroidal grids appropriate for high-resolution, multi-scale general circulation modelling are presented. These grids are shown to satisfy the geometric constraints associated with contemporary unstructured C-grid-type finite-volume models, including the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS-O). The use of user-defined mesh-spacing functions to generate smoothly graded, non-uniform grids for multi-resolution-type studies is discussed in detail.},

abstract = {This study investigates the impact of dynamical downscaling on historical and future projections of winter extratropical cyclones over eastern North America and the western Atlantic Ocean. Six-hourly output from two global circulation models (GCMs), CCSM4 and GFDL-ESM2M, from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are used to create the initial and boundary conditions for 20 historical (1986-2005) and 20 future (2080-99) winter simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. Two sets of WRF grid spacing (1.0° and 0.2°) are examined to determine the impact of model resolution. Although the cyclone frequency in the WRF runs is largely determined by the GCM predictions, the higher-resolution WRF reduces the underprediction in cyclone intensity. There is an increase in late-twenty-first-century cyclone activity over the east coast of North America in CCSM4 and its WRF, whereas there is little change in GFDL-ESM2M and WRF given that there is a larger decrease in the temperature gradient in this region. There is a future increase in relatively deep cyclones over the East Coast in the high-resolution WRF forced by CCSM4. These storms are weaker than the historical cases early in their life cycle, but then because of latent heating they rapidly develop and become stronger than the historical events. This increase does not occur in the low-resolution WRF or the high-resolution WRF forced by GFDL since the latent heat increase is relatively small. This implies that the diabatic processes during cyclogenesis may become more important in a warmer climate, and these processes may be too weak in existing coarse-resolution GCMs.},

@article{Darestani2021,
abstract = {Distribution systems in the US are commonly supported by wood utility poles. Since wood poles may experience substantial decay rates, current standards specify a strength-based maintenance program for pole replacement regardless of the poles' vulnerability and importance in the system. While state-of-the-art methods have developed risk-based metrics to guide system hardening decisions, such metrics are analyzed for the current conditions of the system. In this context, the potential of a stochastic series of hazards over extended horizons and the subsequent effects on the resilience of systems have been largely neglected. To address these limitations, a risk-based methodology is proposed for quantifying the life cycle resilience of power distribution systems. To project pole vulnerability, a recursive approach is developed that captures the stochasticity of precedent failures and subsequent corrective actions over extended horizons. Furthermore, a risk-based replacement index called Expected Outage Reduction (EOR) is introduced that estimates the expected power outage reduction if an existing pole is replaced by a new pole. The application of the proposed method for life cycle resilience analysis and management of a realistic distribution system subjected to stochastic hurricanes indicates that EOR can improve the cumulative life cycle resilience by up to 22.3{\%} over 70 years.},

abstract = {After decades of study and significant data collection of time-varying swash on sandy beaches, there is no single deterministic prediction scheme for wave runup that eliminates prediction error - even bespoke, locally tuned predictors present scatter when compared to observations. Scatter in runup prediction is meaningful and can be used to create probabilistic predictions of runup for a given wave climate and beach slope. This contribution demonstrates this using a data-driven Gaussian process predictor; a probabilistic machine-learning technique. The runup predictor is developed using 1 year of hourly wave runup data (8328 observations) collected by a fixed lidar at Narrabeen Beach, Sydney, Australia. The Gaussian process predictor accurately predicts hourly wave runup elevation when tested on unseen data with a root-mean-squared error of 0.18m and bias of 0.02m. The uncertainty estimates output from the probabilistic GP predictor are then used practically in a deterministic numerical model of coastal dune erosion, which relies on a parameterization of wave runup, to generate ensemble predictions. When applied to a dataset of dune erosion caused by a storm event that impacted Narrabeen Beach in 2011, the ensemble approach reproduced {\textless}span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"{\textgreater}ĝ1/485{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\%} of the observed variability in dune erosion along the 3.5 km beach and provided clear uncertainty estimates around these predictions. This work demonstrates how data-driven methods can be used with traditional deterministic models to develop ensemble predictions that provide more information and greater forecasting skill when compared to a single model using a deterministic parameterization - an idea that could be applied more generally to other numerical models of geomorphic systems.},

There is a need to incorporate the impact of tide-surge interaction and the spatial and temporal variability of the combined flood hazard in flood risk assessments, especially in hyper-tidal estuaries where the consequences of tide and storm surge concurrence can be catastrophic. Delft3D-FLOW is used to assess up-estuary variability in extreme water levels for a range of historical events of different severity within the Severn Estuary, southwest England as an example. The influence of the following on flood hazard is investigated: (i) event severity, (ii) timing of the peak of a storm surge relative to tidal high water and (iii) the temporal distribution of the storm surge component (here in termed the surge skewness). Results show when modelling a local area event severity is most important control on flood hazard. Tide-surge concurrence increases flood hazard throughout the estuary. Positive surge skewness can result in a greater variability of extreme water levels and residual surge component, the effects of which are magnified up-estuary by estuarine geometry to exacerbate flood hazard. The concepts and methodology shown here can be applied to other estuaries worldwide.},

abstract = {This paper presents a five-year global simulation of HYCOM, the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model, that simultaneously resolves the eddying general circulation, barotropic tides, and baroclinic tides with 32 layers in the vertical direction and 1/12.5° (equatorial) horizontal grid spacing. A parameterized topographic wave drag is inserted into the model and tuned so that the surface tidal elevations are of comparable accuracy to those in optimally tuned forward tide models used in previous studies. The model captures 93{\%} of the open-ocean sea-surface height variance of the eight largest tidal constituents, as recorded by a standard set of 102 pelagic tide gauges spread around the World Ocean. In order to minimize the impact of the wave drag on non-tidal motions, the model utilizes a running 25-h average to approximately separate tidal and non-tidal components of the near-bottom flow. In contrast to earlier high-resolution global baroclinic tide simulations, which utilized tidal forcing only, the simulation presented here has a horizontally non-uniform stratification, supported by the wind- and buoyancy forcing. The horizontally varying stratification affects the baroclinic tides in high latitudes to first order. The magnitude of the internal tide perturbations to sea surface elevation amplitude and phase in a large box surrounding Hawai'i is quite similar to that observed in satellite altimeter data, although the exact locations of peaks and troughs in the modeled perturbations differ from those in the observed perturbations.},

These processes combine to induce a combined flow bed shear stress upon the seabed which can mobilise sediments or directly influence organisms disturbing the benthic environment. Output from a suite of numerical models predicting these oceanic processes have been utilised to compute the combined flow bed shear stresses over the entire Australian continental shelf for an 8-year period (March 1997-February 2005 inclusive). To quantify the relative influence of extreme or catastrophic combined flow bed shear stress events and more frequent events of smaller magnitude, three methods of classifying the oceanographic levels of exposure are presented: (1) A spectral regionalisation method, (2) A method based on the shape of the probability distribution function, and (3) A method which assesses the balance between the amount of work a stress does on the seabed, and the frequency with which it occurs. Significant relationships occur between the three regionalisation maps indicating seabed exposure to oceanographic processes and physical sediment properties (mean grain size and bulk carbonate content), and water depth, particularly when distinction is made between regions dominated by high-frequency (diurnal or semi-diurnal) events and low-frequency (synoptic or annual) events. It is concluded that both magnitude and frequency of combined-flow bed shear stresses must be considered when characterising the benthic environment. The regionalisation outputs of the Australian continental shelf presented in this study are expected to be of benefit to quantifying exposure of seabed habitats on the continental shelf to oceanographic processes in future habitat classification schemes for marine planning and policy procedures.

abstract = {The dynamic processes of bore propagation over a uniform slope are studied numerically using a 2-D Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) solver, coupled to a non-linear k−$\epsilon$ turbulence closure and a volume of fluid (VOF) method. The dam-break mechanism is used to generate bores in a constant depth region. Present numerical results for the ensemble-averaged flow field are compared with existing experimental data as well as theoretical and numerical results based on non-linear shallow water (NSW) equations. Reasonable agreement between the present numerical solutions and experimental data is observed. Using the numerical results, small-scale bore behaviors and flow features, such as the bore collapse process near the still-water shoreline, the ‘mini-collapse' during the runup phase and the ‘back-wash bore' in the down-rush phase, are described. In the case of a strong bore, the evolution of the averaged turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) over the swash zone consists of two phases: in the region near the still-water shoreline, the production and the dissipation of TKE are roughly in balance; in the region farther landwards of the still-water shoreline, the TKE decay rate is very close to that of homogeneous grid turbulence. On the other hand, in the case of a weak bore, the bore collapse generated turbulence is confined near the bottom boundary layer and the TKE decays at a much slower rate.},

abstract = {A numerical method, which combines the boundary element method (BEM) and the volume of the fluid method (VOF method), has been presented to solve wave–structure interactions; the intense wave motion at the proximity of the structure is modeled by the VOF method and the rest of the fluid region is modeled by the BEM. The combined method can considerably reduce the time-consuming VOF domain, and thus practically makes it possible to apply the VOF method for random wave calculations, in which long time computations are usually required to obtain statistically meaningful results, and therefore the use of the single-VOF model often becomes prohibitive in terms of computational time and storage memories. A VOF model CADMAS-SURF, which is based on SMAC scheme and had been constructed by a number of VOF researchers in coastal engineering in Japan, is used in the combined BEM–VOF model. The two-way coupling treatment, which enables us to deal with bidirectional wave propagations, which was originally given for the SOLA-VOF model by Yan et al. (2003a) and later improved by Kim et al. (2007), was modified for the SMAC scheme. The coupling treatments are described in detail in the paper. The validity of the combined BEM–VOF model was investigated by comparing the numerical results with the theoretical results for the propagations of Stokes 5th order waves and random waves.},

abstract = {Experimental studies on tsunami are carried out since many years, most of them by generating solitary waves with a piston type wave maker. However, today it is more and more appreciated that these kinds of waves actually do not represent a real tsunami very well, as particularly for the shallow waters at the coast the wave length becomes comparably far too short. Recently new generation methods for scaled down real tsunami experiments were suggested, as it was doubted that sufficiently long waves could be generated with a classical wave maker. The present paper shall disprove these arguments by providing results of a study carried out in the Large Wave Flume (Gro{\ss}er Wellenkanal, GWK), where waves of periods between 30s and more than 100s at 1m water depth were successfully generated with a piston type wave maker. Results for elongated solitary waves, trough led N-waves and real tsunami records as a combination of a different number of general solitons (sech2 waves) are presented. Finally, the requirements and limitations to bring a “real” tsunami into the laboratory are discussed.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The ocean plays an important role in modulating the mass balance of the polar ice sheets by interacting with the ice shelves in Antarctica and with the marine-terminating outlet glaciers in Greenland. Given that the flux of warm water onto the continental shelf and into the sub-ice cavities is steered by complex bathymetry, a detailed topography data set is an essential ingredient for models that address ice-ocean interaction. We followed the spirit of the global RTopo-1 data set and compiled consistent maps of global ocean bathymetry, upper and lower ice surface topographies and global surface height on a spherical grid with now 30-arc seconds resolution. We used the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO{\_}2014) as the backbone and added the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean version 3 (IBCAOv3) and the International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean (IBCSO) version 1. While RTopo-1 primarily aimed at a good and consistent representation of the Antarctic ice sheet, ice shelves and sub-ice cavities, RTopo-2 now also contains ice topographies of the Greenland ice sheet and outlet glaciers. In particular, we aimed at a good representation of the fjord and shelf bathymetry surrounding the Greenland continent. We corrected data from earlier gridded products in the areas of Petermann Glacier, Hagen Br{\ae} and Sermilik Fjord assuming that sub-ice and fjord bathymetries roughly follow plausible Last Glacial Maximum ice flow patterns. For the continental shelf off northeast Greenland and the floating ice tongue of Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden Glacier at about 79°{\&}thinsp;N, we incorporated a high-resolution digital bathymetry model considering original multibeam survey data for the region. Radar data for surface topographies of the floating ice tongues of Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden Glacier and Zachari{\ae} Isstr{\o}m have been obtained from the data centers of Technical University of Denmark (DTU), Operation Icebridge (NASA/NSF) and Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI). For the Antarctic ice sheet/ice shelves, RTopo-2 largely relies on the Bedmap-2 product but applies corrections for the geometry of Getz, Abbot and Fimbul ice shelf cavities.

abstract = {Compound flooding, characterized by the co-occurrence of multiple flood mechanisms, is a major threat to coastlines across the globe. Tropical cyclones (TCs) are responsible for many compound floods due to their storm surge and intense rainfall. Previous efforts to quantify compound flood hazard have typically adopted statistical approaches that may be unable to fully capture spatio-temporal dynamics between rainfall-runoff and storm surge, which ultimately impact total water levels. In contrast, we pose a physics-driven approach that utilizes a large set of realistic TC events and a simplified physics-based rainfall model and simulates each event within a hydrodynamic model framework. We apply our approach to investigate TC flooding in the Cape Fear River, NC. We find TC approach angle, forward speed, and intensity are relevant for compound flood potential, but rainfall rate and time lag between the centroid of rainfall and peak storm tide are the strongest predictors of compounding magnitude. Neglecting rainfall underestimates 100-year flood depths across 28{\%} of the floodplain, and taking the maximum of each hazard modeled separately still underestimates 16{\%} of the floodplain. We find the main stem of the river is surge-dominated, upstream portions of small streams and pluvial areas are rainfall dominated, but midstream portions of streams are compounding zones, and areas close to the coastline are surge dominated for lower return periods but compounding zones for high return periods (100 years). Our method links joint rainfall-surge occurrence to actual flood impacts and demonstrates how compound flooding is distributed across coastal catchments.},

We evaluate WRF model performance for a historical simulation and future projections, applying the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) as initial and boundary conditions with and without a bias correction. WRF simulations using boundary and initial conditions from both versions of CCSM4 show smaller biases versus evaluation data sets than does CCSM4 over western North America. WRF simulations also improve spatial details of precipitation over much of North America. However, driving the WRF with the bias-corrected CCSM4 does not always reduce the bias. WRF-projected changes in precipitation include decreasing intensity over the southwestern United States, increasing intensity over the eastern United Sates and most of Canada, and an increase in the number of days with heavy precipitation over much of North America. Projected precipitation changes are more evident in the late 21st century than the mid 21st century, and they are more evident under RCP 8.5 than under RCP 4.5 in the late 21st century. Uncertainties in the projected changes in precipitation due to different warming scenarios are non-negligible. Differences in summer precipitation changes between WRF and CCSM4 are significant over most of the United States.},

abstract = {For applications such as windstorm underwriting or storm-surge forecasting, hurricane wind profiles are often approximated by continuous functions that are zero at the vortex center, increase to a maximum in the eyewall, and then decrease asymptotically to zero far from the center. Comparisons between the most commonly used functions and aircraft observations reveal systematic errors. Although winds near the peak are too strong, they decrease too rapidly with distance away from the peak. Pressure-wind relations for these profiles typically overestimate maximum winds. A promising alternative is a family of sectionally continuous profiles in which the wind increases as a power of radius inside the eye and decays exponentially outside the eye after a smooth polynomial transition across the eyewall. Based upon a sample of 493 observed profiles, the mean exponent for the power law is 0.79 and the mean decay length is 243 km. The database actually contains 606 aircraft sorties, but 113 of these failed quality-control screening. Hurricanes stronger than Saffir-Simpson category 2 often require two exponentials to match the observed rapid decrease of wind with radius just outside the eye and slower decrease farther away. Experimentation showed that a fixed value of 25 km was satisfactory for the faster decay length. The mean value of the slower decay length was 295 km. The mean contribution of the faster exponential to the outer profile was 0.10, but for the most intense hurricanes it sometimes exceeded 0.5. The power-law exponent and proportion of the faster decay length increased with maximum wind speed and decreased with latitude, whereas the slower decay length decreased with intensity and increased with latitude, consistent with the qualitative observation that more intense hurricanes in lower latitudes usually have more sharply peaked wind profiles. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Large estuaries are especially vulnerable to coastal flooding due to the potential of combined storm surges and riverine flows. Numerical models can support flood prevention and planning for coastal communities. However, while recent advancements in the development of numerical models for storm surge prediction have led to robust and accurate models; an increasing number of parameters and physical processes' representations are available to modelers and engineers. This study investigates uncertainties associated with the selection of physical parameters or processes involved in storm surge modeling in large estuaries. Specifically, we explored the sensitivity of a hydrodynamic model (ADCIRC) and a coupled wind-wave and circulation model system (ADCIRC + SWAN) to Manning's n coefficient, wind waves and circulation interaction (wave setup), minimum depth (H0) in the wetting and drying algorithm, and spatially constant horizontal eddy viscosity (ESLM) forced by tides and hurricane winds. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis to Manning's n coefficient and the interaction of waves and circulation were analyzed by using three different numerical meshes. Manning's coefficient analysis was divided into waterway (rivers, bay and shore, and open ocean) and overland. Overall, the rivers exhibited a larger sensitivity, and M2 amplitude and maximum water elevations were reduced by 0.20 m and 0.56 m, respectively, by using a high friction value; similarly, high friction reduced maximum water levels up to 0.30 m in overland areas; the wave setup depended on the offshore wave height, angle of breaking, the profile morphology, and the mesh resolution, accounting for up to 0.19 m setup inside the bay; minimum depth analysis showed that H0 = 0.01 added an artificial mass of water in marshes and channels, meanwhile H = 0.1 partially solved this problem; and the eddy viscosity study demonstrated that the ESLM = 40 values reduced up to 0.40 m the peak of the maximum water levels in the upper side of narrow rivers.},

The new advection scheme for the momentum equation includes an iterative smoother to reduce excess mass produced by higher-order kriging method, and a new viscosity formulation is shown to work robustly for generic unstructured grids and effectively filter out spurious modes without introducing excessive dissipation. A new higher-order implicit advection scheme for transport (TVD2) is proposed to effectively handle a wide range of Courant numbers as commonly found in typical cross-scale applications. The addition of quadrangular elements into the model, together with a recently proposed, highly flexible vertical grid system (Zhang et al., A new vertical coordinate system for a 3D unstructured-grid model. Ocean Model. 85, 2015), leads to model polymorphism that unifies 1D/2DH/2DV/3D cells in a single model grid. Results from several test cases demonstrate the model's good performance in the eddying regime, which presents greater challenges for unstructured-grid models and represents the last missing link for our cross-scale model. The model can thus be used to simulate cross-scale processes in a seamless fashion (i.e. from deep ocean into shallow depths).},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Accurately representing coastal and shelf seas in global ocean models represents one of the grand challenges of Earth System science. They are regions of immense societal importance, through the goods and services they provide, hazards they pose and through their role in global scale processes and cycles, e.g. carbon fluxes and dense water formation. However, they are poorly represented in the current generation of global ocean models. In this contribution we aim to identify and quantify the important physical processes, and their scales, needed to address this issue in the context of the options available to resolve these scales globally and the evolving computational landscape. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} We find barotropic and topographic scales are well resolved by the current state-of-the-art model resolutions (e.g. nominal 1/12{\&}deg;) and here the focus is on process representation. We identify tides, vertical coordinates, river inflows and mixing schemes as four areas where modelling approaches can readily be transferred from regional to global modelling with substantial benefit. We demonstrate this through basin scale northern North Atlantic simulations and analysis of global profile data, which particularly shows the need for increased vertical resolution in shallower water. In terms of finer scale processes, we find that a 1/12{\&}deg; global model resolves the 1{\textless}sup{\textgreater}st{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} baroclinic Rossby Radius for only {\~{}}{\&}thinsp;20{\&}thinsp;{\%} of regions {\textless}{\&}thinsp;500{\&}thinsp;m deep, but this increases to {\~{}}{\&}thinsp;90{\&}thinsp;{\%} for a 1/72{\&}deg; model, so to resolve these scales globally requires substantially finer resolution than the current state-of-the-art. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} We consider a simple scale analysis and conceptual grid refining approach to explore the balance between the size of a globally refined model and that of multiscale modelling options (e.g. finite element, finite volume or a 2-way nesting approach). We put this analysis in the context of evolving computer systems, using the UK's national research facility as an example. This doubles in peak performance every {\~{}}{\&}thinsp;1.2 years. Using a simple cost-model compared to a reference configuration (taken to be a 1/4{\&}deg; global model in 2011), we estimate an unstructured mesh multiscale approach resolving process scales down to 1.5{\&}thinsp;km would use a comparable share of the computer resource by 2024, the 2-way nested multiscale approach by 2022, and a 1/72{\&}deg; global model by 2026. However, we also note that a 1/12{\&}deg; global model would not have a comparable computational cost to a 1{\&}deg; global model today until 2027. Hence, we conclude that for computationally expensive models (e.g. for oceanographic research or operational oceanography), resolving scales to {\~{}}{\&}thinsp;1.5{\&}thinsp;km would be routinely practical in about a decade given substantial effort on numerical and computational development. For complex Earth System Models this extends to about two decades, suggesting the focus here needs to be on improved process parameterisation to meet these challenges.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Anew empirical model of ocean tides has been developed for the Weddell Sea, south of 668S, between 908W and 08, using six years of radar altimeter data from the CryoSat-2 satellite mission. Because of its long groundtrack repeat period (368 days) and its diverse measurement modes, low-rate mode (LRM) over the ocean and synthetic aperture radar interferometric mode (SARin) over ice surfaces and parts of the ocean, the CryoSat- 2 data pose a number of challenges for tidal analysis. The space and time sampling properties of the exact repeat, near-repeat, and crossover ground tracks have been analyzed to discover which tides may be estimated using a combination of conventional harmonic analysis and local spatial regression. Using this information, theM2, S2, K2, N2, K1, O1, P1, andQ1 tides have been mapped for both the ocean and floating ice shelves in this domain. Validation against independent in situ data, along with comparison with existing tide models, finds that the CryoSat-2-derived tides are consistent with previous estimates and that they are more accurate than other models at theM2 and S2 frequencies. The high inclination of the CryoSat-2 orbit causes the orbit plane to precess relatively slowly, which leads to significantly less accurate estimates of theK2 tide. This purely empirical model ought to provide improved tidal corrections for studies of low-frequency variability and secular trends in ice shelf thickness, and it suggests that further increases in quantitative accuracy could be achieved by assimilation of CryoSat-2 data into dynamical tide models.},

abstract = {The objective of the Coastal and Inland Flooding Observation and Warning (CI-FLOW) project is to prototype new hydrometeorologic techniques to address a critical NOAA service gap: routine total water level predictions for tidally influenced watersheds. Since February 2000, the project has focused on developing a coupled modeling system to accurately account for water at all locations in a coastal watershed by exchanging data between atmospheric, hydrologic, and hydrodynamic models. These simulations account for the quantity of water associated with waves, tides, storm surge, rivers, and rainfall, including interactions at the tidal/surge interface. Within this project, CI-FLOW addresses the following goals: i) apply advanced weather and oceanographic monitoring and prediction techniques to the coastal environment; ii) prototype an automated hydrometeorologic data collection and prediction system; iii) facilitate interdisciplinary and multiorganizational collaborations; and iv) enhance techniques and technologies that improve actionable hydrologic/hydrodynamic information to reduce the impacts of coastal flooding. Results are presented for Hurricane Isabel (2003), Hurricane Earl (2010), and Tropical Storm Nicole (2010) for the Tar-Pamlico and Neuse River basins of North Carolina. This area was chosen, in part, because of the tremendous damage inflicted by Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd (1999). The vision is to transition CI-FLOW research findings and tethnologies to other U.S. coastal watersheds. (Page 1427)},

abstract = {In this work we extend a high-order Boussinesq-type (finite difference) model, capable of simulating waves out to wavenumber times depth kh{\textless}25, to include a moving sea-bed, for the simulation of earthquake- and landslide-induced tsunamis. The extension is straight forward, requiring only an additional term within the kinematic bottom condition. As first test cases we simulate linear and nonlinear surface waves generated from both positive and negative impulsive bottom movements. The computed results compare well against earlier theoretical, numerical, and experimental values. Additionally, we show that the long-time (fully nonlinear) evolution of waves resulting from an upthrusted bottom can eventually result in true solitary waves, consistent with theoretical predictions. It is stressed, however, that the nonlinearity used far exceeds that typical of geophysical tsunamis in the open ocean. The Boussinesq-type model is then used to simulate numerous tsunami-type events generated from submerged landslides, in both one and two horizontal dimensions. The results again compare well against previous experiments and/or numerical simulations. The new extension compliments recently developed run-up capabilities within this approach, and as demonstrated, the model can therefore treat tsunami events from their initial generation, through their later propagation, and final run-up phases. The developed model is shown to maintain reasonable computational efficiency, and is therefore attractive for the simulation of such events, especially in cases where dispersion is important.},

The problem is characterized by two nondimensional parameters, A and B. The first parameter, A, is the ridge half-width scaled by $\mu$h, where h is the uniform depth of the ocean far from the ridge and $\mu$ is the inverse slope of internal tidal rays (horizontal run over vertical rise). The second parameter, B, is the ridge height scaled by h. Two topographic profiles are considered: a triangular or tent-shaped ridge and a “polynomial” ridge with continuous topographic slope. For both profiles, complete coverage of the (A, B) parameter space is obtained by reducing the problem to an integral equation, which is then discretized and solved numerically. It is shown that in the supercritical regime (ray slopes steeper than topographic slopes) the radiated power increases monotonically with B ...},

abstract = {Coastal flooding is a major global hazard, yet few studies have examined the spatial and temporal characteristics of extreme sea level and associated coastal flooding. Here we analyse sea-level records around the coast of New Zealand (NZ) to quantify extreme storm-tide and skew-surge frequency and magnitude. We identify the relative magnitude of sea-level components contributing to 85 extreme sea level and 135 extreme skew-surge events recorded in NZ since 1900. We then examine the spatial and temporal clustering of these extreme storm-tide and skew-surge events and identify typical storm tracks and weather types associated with the spatial clusters of extreme events. We find that most extreme storm tides were driven by moderate skew surges combined with high perigean spring tides. The spring-neap tidal cycle, coupled with a moderate surge climatology, prevents successive extreme storm-tide events from happening within 4-10 d of each other, and generally there are at least 10 d between extreme storm-tide events. This is similar to findings from the UK (Haigh et al., 2016), despite NZ having smaller tides. Extreme events more commonly impacted the east coast of the North Island of NZ during blocking weather types, and the South Island and west coast of the North Island during trough weather types. The seasonal distribution of both extreme storm-tide and skew-surge events closely follows the seasonal pattern of mean sea-level anomaly (MSLA) - MSLA was positive in 92 {\%} of all extreme storm-tide events and in 88 {\%} of all extreme skew-surge events. The strong influence of low-amplitude (-0.06 to 0.28 m) MSLA on the timing of extreme events shows that mean sea-level rise (SLR) of similarly small height will drive rapid increases in the frequency of presently rare extreme sea levels. These findings have important implications for flood management, emergency response and the insurance sector, because impacts and losses may be correlated in space and time.},

abstract = {A global tuning experiment for the semidiurnal tide is performed with a barotropic model. The model is forced with the M2 equilibrium tide and accounts for the self-attraction and loading (SAL) term. In addition to a quadratic drag, various linear internal wave drag terms adjusted by a scale factor of O(1) are applied. The drag terms include the original Nycander (2005) tensor scheme, the Nycander tensor scheme reduced at supercritical slopes, and their scalar sisters, a Nycander scalar scheme computed for additional abyssal hill roughness, and the Jayne and St. Laurent (2001) scalar scheme. The Nycander scheme does not have a tunable parameter, but to obtain the best tidal solutions, it is demonstrated that some tuning is unavoidable. It is shown that the scalar Nycander schemes yield slightly lower root-mean square (RMS) elevation errors vs. the data-assimilative TPXO tide model than the tensor schemes. Although the simulation with the optimally tuned original Nycander scalar yields dissipation rates close to TPXO, the RMS error is among the highest. The RMS error is lowered for the reduced schemes, which place relatively more dissipation in deeper water. The inclusion of abyssal hill roughness improves the regional agreement with TPXO dissipation rates, without changing the RMS errors. It is difficult to have each ocean basin optimally tuned with the application of a constant scale factor. The relatively high RMS error in the Atlantic Ocean is reduced with a spatially varying scale factor with a larger value in the Atlantic. Our best global mean RMS error of 4.4cm for areas deeper than 1000m and equatorward of 66° is among the lowest obtained in a forward barotropic tide model.},

abstract = {We revisit the challenges and prospects for ocean circulation models following Griffies et al. (2010). Over the past decade, ocean circulation models evolved through improved understanding, numerics, spatial discretization, grid configurations, parameterizations, data assimilation, environmental monitoring, and process-level observations and modeling. Important large scale applications over the last decade are simulations of the Southern Ocean, the Meridional Overturning Circulation and its variability, and regional sea level change. Submesoscale variability is now routinely resolved in process models and permitted in a few global models, and submesoscale effects are parameterized in most global models. The scales where nonhydrostatic effects become important are beginning to be resolved in regional and process models. Coupling to sea ice, ice shelves, and high-resolution atmospheric models has stimulated new ideas and driven improvements in numerics. Observations have provided insight into turbulence and mixing around the globe and its consequences are assessed through perturbed physics models. Relatedly, parameterizations of the mixing and overturning processes in boundary layers and the ocean interior have improved. New diagnostics being used for evaluating models alongside present and novel observations are briefly referenced. The overall goal is summarizing new developments in ocean modeling, including: how new and existing observations can be used, what modeling challenges remain, and how simulations can be used to support observations.},

abstract = {The effect of ocean downwind swells on the harvesting of offshore wind energy is studied using large-eddy simulation of fully developed wind turbine array boundary layers, which is dynamically coupled with high-order spectral simulation of sea-surface wave field with and without the presence of a downwind swell. For the two moderate wind speeds of 7m/s and 10m/s considered in this study, the swell is found to induce a temporal oscillation in the extracted wind power at the swell frequency, with a magnitude of 6.7{\%} and 4.0{\%} of the mean wind power output, respectively. Furthermore, the averaged wind power extraction is found to be increased by as much as 18.8{\%} and 13.6{\%}, respectively. Statistical analysis of the wind field indicates that the wind speed in the lower portion of the boundary layer oscillates periodically with fast wind above the swell trough and slow wind above the swell crest, resulting in the observed wind power oscillation. The wind above the swell accelerates due to the strong wave forcing, causes a net upward flux of kinetic energy into the wind turbine layer, and thus acts to increase the extracted wind power of the turbines. For a high wind speed of 17m/s, the wave-induced motion becomes relatively weak and the swell effect on the wind turbine performance diminishes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The bathymetry is produced using a combination of shipboard soundings and depths predicted using satellite altimetry. New data consists of {\textgreater}33.6 million multibeam and singlebeam measurements collated by several institutions, namely, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Geoscience Australia, Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping, and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. New altimetry data consists of 48, 14, and 12 months of retracked range measurements from Cryosat-2, SARAL/AltiKa, and Jason-2, respectively. With respect to SRTM15{\_}PLUS (Olson et al.,), the inclusion of these new data results in a ∼1.4-km improvement in the minimum wavelength recovered for sea surface free-air gravity anomalies, a small increase in the accuracy of altimetrically derived predicted depths, and a 1.24{\%} increase, from 9.60{\%} to 10.84{\%}, in the total area of ocean floor that is constrained by shipboard soundings at 15-arc sec resolution. Bathymetric grid cells constrained by satellite altimetry have estimated uncertainties of ±150 m in the deep oceans and ±180 m between coastlines and the continental rise. Onshore, topography data are sourced from previously published digital elevation models, predominately SRTM-CGIAR V4.1 between 60°N and 60°S. ArcticDEM is used above 60°N, while Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica is used below 62°S.

abstract = {Due to the devastating effects of recent hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico (e.g., Katrina, Rita, Ike and Gustav), the development of a high-resolution, real-time, total water level prototype system has been accelerated. The fully coupled model system that includes hydrology is an extension of the ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS), and will henceforth be referred to as ASGS-STORM (Scalable, Terrestrial, Ocean, River, Meteorological) to emphasize the major processes that are represented by the system.The ASGS-STORM system incorporates tides, waves, winds, rivers and surge to produce a total water level, which provides a holistic representation of coastal flooding. ASGS-STORM was rigorously tested during Hurricane Irene, which made landfall in late August 2011 in North Carolina. All results from ASGS-STORM for the advisories were produced in real-time, forced by forecast wind and pressure fields computed using a parametric tropical cyclone model, and made available via the web. Herein, a skill assessment, analyzing wind speed and direction, significant wave heights, and total water levels, is used to evaluate ASGS-STORM's performance during Irene for three advisories and the best track from the National Hurricane Center (NHC). ASGS-STORM showed slight over-prediction for two advisories (Advisory 23 and 25) due to the over-estimation of the storm intensity. However, ASGS-STORM shows notable skill in capturing total water levels, wind speed and direction, and significant wave heights in North Carolina when utilizing Advisory 28, which had a slight shift in the track but provided a more accurate estimation of the storm intensity, along with the best track from the NHC. Results from ASGS-STORM have shown that as the forecast of the advisories improves, so does the accuracy of the models used in the study; therefore, accurate input from the weather forecast is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to ensure the accuracy of the guidance provided by the system. While Irene provided a real-time test of the viability of a total water level system, the relatively insignificant freshwater discharges precludes definitive conclusions about the role of freshwater discharges on total water levels in estuarine zones. Now that the system has been developed, on-going work will examine storms (e.g., Floyd) for which the freshwater discharge played a more meaningful role. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Jia2013,
abstract = {One of the important recent advances in the field of hurricane/storm modeling has been the development of high-fidelity numerical models that facilitate accurate but also computationally intensive simulations of hurricane responses. For efficient implementation in probabilistic hurricane risk assessment, that typically requires simulation of a large number of hurricane scenarios within the coastal regions of interest, combination with metamodeling approaches has been recently proposed. In this work, kriging is investigated for this purpose, focusing on implementation for real-time assessment, i.e. for evaluating risk during an incoming event (and prior to the hurricane/storm making landfall), and on facilitating the development of efficient standalone tools. An important characteristic of this application is that the model output is very high dimensional, since the hurricane response is calculated in a large coastal region and potentially at different time instances. This makes it impractical to establish a different metamodel for each different output. Considering, though, the potential -spatial and/or temporal- correlation between the different outputs combination with principal component analysis (PCA) is proposed here. This analysis extracts a much smaller number of latent outputs to approximate the initial high-dimensional output. A separate metamodel is then developed for each latent output. Comparisons between kriging with and without PCA and between kriging and moving least squares response surface approximations are discussed in terms of both computational efficiency (speed) and memory requirements. Both these are important considerations when discussing the development of standalone tools that can efficiently run in personal laptops (or even smartphones) of emergency response managers. The impact of the number of latent outputs considered is investigated in this context, and also the optimal selection of basis and correlation functions for the kriging is discussed. Finally for calculating risk the prediction error stemming from the metamodel is explicitly addressed (i.e., the assessment does not rely only on the mean kriging response). The proposed approach is demonstrated for real-time hurricane risk assessment for the Hawaiian Islands, focusing in the region around Oahu. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The ability to predict the presence and physical properties of small-scale sand ripples on the sea bed is important for determining the bed roughness felt by currents and waves, for sediment transport applications, and for acoustic applications. A fully time-evolving model is presented for predicting the height, length and orientation of sand ripples generated by currents, waves or both, which includes processes dealing with threshold of motion, ripple wash-out and biological degradation. We believe that this is currently the only predictor to feature all these properties, and is thus more widely applicable to shelf seas than other more sophisticated, but less comprehensive, methods. Tests against a large data-set of observations using an Acoustic Ripple Profiler at a site on the east coast of England, where ripples are generated by both tidal currents and waves, showed that the predictor captures most of the main features observed. A modified criterion for the wave/current dominance in the prediction equations improved some aspects of the agreement. The properties of current-generated ripples are predicted accurately, but the wavelength, and to a lesser extent the height, of wave-generated ripples show some under-prediction. Ripple orientations are modelled in an approximate way, but the main features of the observed orientations are captured. The bio-degradation feature of the predictor could not be tested with this data-set. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {We review the characteristics of sea level variability at the coast focussing on how it differs from the variability in the nearby deep ocean. Sea level variability occurs on all timescales, with processes at higher frequencies tending to have a larger magnitude at the coast due to resonance and other dynamics. In the case of some processes, such as the tides, the presence of the coast and the shallow waters of the shelves results in the processes being considerably more complex than offshore. However, ‘coastal variability' should not always be considered as ‘short spatial scale variability' but can be the result of signals transmitted along the coast from 1000s km away. Fortunately, thanks to tide gauges being necessarily located at the coast, many aspects of coastal sea level variability can be claimed to be better understood than those in the deep ocean. Nevertheless, certain aspects of coastal variability remain under-researched, including how changes in some processes (e.g., wave setup, river runoff) may have contributed to the historical mean sea level records obtained from tide gauges which are now used routinely in large-scale climate research.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Tide predictions based on tide-gauge observations are not just the astronomical tides; they also contain radiational tides – periodic sea-level changes due to atmospheric conditions and solar forcing. This poses a problem of double-counting for operational forecasts of total water level during storm surges. In some surge forecasting, a regional model is run in two modes: tide only, with astronomic forcing alone; and tide and surge, forced additionally by surface winds and pressure. The surge residual is defined to be the difference between these configurations and is added to the local harmonic predictions from gauges. Here we use the Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM) based on Delft-FM to investigate this in the UK and elsewhere, quantifying the weather-related tides that may be double-counted in operational forecasts.

abstract = {AbstractThe conversion of barotropic to baroclinic tidal energy in the global abyssal ocean is calculated using three different formulations. The calculations are done both “offline,” that is, using externally given tidal currents to estimate the energy conversion, and “online,” that is, by using the formulations to parameterize linear wave drag in a prognostic tidal model. All three schemes produce globally integrated offline dissipation rates beneath 500-m depth of {\~{}}0.6–0.8 TW for the M2 constituent, but the spatial structures vary significantly between the parameterizations. Detailed investigations of the energy transfer in local areas confirm the global results: there are large differences between the schemes, although the horizontally integrated conversion rates are similar. The online simulations are evaluated by comparing the sea surface elevation with data from the TOPEX/Poseidon database, and the error is then significantly lower when using the parameterization provided by Nycander than with the ...},

Defined as the wavelength with equal balanced and unbalanced motion kinetic energy (KE) spectral density, Lt is detected to be geographically highly inhomogeneous: it falls below 40 km in the western boundary current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current regions, increases to 40-100 km in the interior subtropical and subpolar gyres, and exceeds, in general, 200 km in the tropical oceans. With the exception of the Pacific and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean, the seasonal KE fluctuations of the surface balanced and unbalanced motions are out of phase because of the occurrence of mixed layer instability in winter and trapping of unbalanced motion KE in shallow mixed layer in summer. The combined effect of these seasonal changes renders Lt to be 20 km during winter in 80{\%} of the Northern Hemisphere oceans between 258 and 458N and all of the Southern Hemisphere oceans south of 258S. The transition scale's geographical and seasonal changes are highly relevant to the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission.

Intrusions of the Kuroshio and strong mesoscale variability in the Luzon Strait can influence their generation and propagation. Here, the authors use eight moorings and two numerical models to investigate these relationships by quantifying the coherence of the diurnal and semidiurnal internal tides in the Luzon Strait. This study finds that the level of coherence of internal tide generation, energy, and energy flux is quite variable, depending on the specific location within the Luzon Strait. Large-scale spatial patterns in internal tide pressure and velocity exist across the region, shaped by the bathymetry, mean flow, and stratification. Internal tide coherence is lower ({\textless}30{\%}) near large gradients in this pattern (predominantly along the eastern ridge), which are shifted by the variable Kuroshio and mesoscale fields.

abstract = {Recent studies show that the glaciers draining both the West Antarctic and the Greenland Ice Sheets are experiencing an accelerated ice loss, highlighting the possibility of large-scale ice sheet retreat and sea level rise in the coming centuries and millennia. These sea level changes would vary spatially and could significantly alter global tides as the latter are highly dependent on bathymetry (or water column thickness under ice shelves) and basin shape. This paper investigates how the principal semidiurnal (M2) tidal amplitudes and energy dissipation respond to the nonuniform sea level changes induced by complete ice sheet collapses. The sea level changes are calculated using gravitationally self-consistent sea level theory, and the tides are simulated using an established tidal model. Results from the simulations show global and spatially heterogeneous changes in tidal amplitudes. In addition, pronounced changes in tidal energy dissipation occur in both the open ocean and in shelf-seas, also altering the location of tidal mixing fronts. These changes have the potential to impact ocean mixing, and hence large-scale currents and climate patterns, and the contribution of shelf-sea to the global carbon cycle. The new results highlight the importance of considering changes in the tides in predictions of future climate and reconstructions of past climate phases such as the Last Interglacial.},

@article{Varlas2018,
abstract = {It is generally accepted that the fluid layer surrounding Earth should be considered as a single system at short and longer spatiotemporal scales. The current knowledge on the complex mechanisms of atmosphere-ocean interactions is still insufficient. This translates to the simulation of atmosphere and ocean as a single fully coupled system constructing multi-scale, multi-model integrated modeling systems. In this study, a new two-way coupled atmosphere-ocean wave modeling system is introduced with overarching aim to thoroughly unveil the impact of waves on the sea surface roughness and the atmospheric properties. The newly developed system consists of the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and Hydrology (WRF-Hydro) as the atmospheric component and the Wave model (WAM) as the ocean wave component. WRF and WAM models are coupled using the OASIS Model Coupling Toolkit (OASIS3-MCT) that enables models to communicate and exchange the information required to refine their simulation results. CHAOS (Chemical Hydrological Atmospheric Ocean wave System) has been tested in a high-impact cyclonic system over the Mediterranean Sea employing one-way and two-way coupling simulations to assess the air-sea interactions, currently neglecting the chemical and hydrological capabilities. The encapsulation of the ocean waves in the atmospheric surface layer processes modifies the characteristics of atmospheric flow and determines the ocean wave generation. A remarkable finding is that the coupling of the two systems affects the air-sea momentum, enthalpy and moisture transfer determining the evolution of the cyclonic system. The interactions along the air-sea interface are also reflected in the vertical structure of troposphere and its properties. CHAOS in two-way coupling mode shows an overall improvement of the forecast skill up to 20{\%} over the sea while positively affects the atmospheric predictability over the land.},

abstract = {Storm tide (combination of storm surge and the astronomical tide) flooding is a natural hazard with significant global social and economic consequences. For this reason, government agencies and stakeholders need storm tide flood maps to determine population and infrastructure at risk to present and future levels of inundation. Computer models of varying complexity are able to produce regional-scale storm tide flood maps and current model types are either static or dynamic in their implementation. Static models of storm tide utilize storm tide heights to inundate locations hydrologically connected to the coast, whilst dynamic models simulate physical processes that cause flooding. Static models have been used in regional-scale storm tide flood impact assessments, but model limitations and coarse spatial resolutions contribute to uncertain impact estimates. Dynamic models are better at estimating flooding and impact but are computationally expensive. In this study we have developed a dynamic reduced-complexity model of storm tide flooding that is computationally efficient and is applied at hyper-resolutions ({\textless}100 m cell size) over regional scales. We test the performance of this dynamic reduced-complexity model and a separate static model at three test sites where storm tide observational data are available. Additionally, we perform a flood impact assessment at each site using the dynamic reduced-complexity and static model outputs. Our results show that static models can overestimate observed flood areas up to 204 {\%} and estimate more than twice the number of people, infrastructure, and agricultural land affected by flooding. Overall we find that that a reduced-complexity dynamic model of storm tide provides more conservative estimates of coastal flooding and impact.},

abstract = {Climatology and interannual variations of wintertime extratropical cyclone frequency in CCSM3 twentieth century simulation are compared with the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis during 1950-1999. CCSM3 can simulate the storm tracks reasonably well, although the model produces slightly less cyclones at the beginning of the Pacific and Atlantic storm tracks and weaker poleward deflection over the Pacific. As in the reanalysis, frequency of cyclones stronger than 980 hPa shows significant correlation with the Pacific/North America (PNA) teleconnection pattern over the Pacific region and with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the Atlantic sector. Composite maps are constructed for opposite phases of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the NAO and all anomalous patterns coincide with observed. One CCSM3 twenty-first century A1B scenario realization indicates there is significant increase in the extratropical cyclone frequency on the US west coast and decrease in Alaska. Meanwhile, cyclone frequency increases from the Great Lakes region to Quebec and decreases over the US east coast, suggesting a possible northward shift of the Atlantic storm tracks under the warmer climate. The cyclone frequency anomalies are closely linked to changes in seasonal mean states of the upper-troposphere zonal wind and baroclinicity in the lower troposphere. Due to lack of 6-hourly outputs, we cannot apply the cyclone-tracking algorithm to the other eight CCSM3 realizations. Based on the linkage between the mean state change and the cyclone frequency anomalies, it is likely a common feature among the other ensemble members that cyclone activity is reduced on the East Coast and in Alaska as a result of global warming. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

abstract = {Current bathymetric models for the South China Sea (SCS) are largely based on predicted depths from gravity and sparse single-beam echo-sounder measurements. Such models lack high-resolution coastlines and shallow-water bottom features around atolls and islands. This study refines the gravity field of the SCS using sea surface heights from measurements of satellite altimeter Geosat/GM, ERS-1/GM, Jason-1/GM and the original Cryosat-2. A new one-minute gravity anomaly grid is determined. The modeled gravity anomalies show a 6-mgal RMS discrepancy with shipborne measurements in shallow waters. An altimeter-only bathymetric model is derived from the new gravity grid by the gravity-geological method that uses the latest global and regional models of the ocean depth and marine gravity as a priori knowledge. The new model outperforms current SCS bathymetric models and is accurate to 100m, based on comparison with multi-beam depth measurements. Optical images from IKONOS-2, QuickBird-2, GeoEye-1, WorldView-1-2 and -3, are rectified and digitized to derive the zero (coastline) and 20-m depth contours (reef lines) around 44 atolls, which are integrated with the altimeter-only depths, giving significantly improved accuracies and spatial resolutions in modeled depths. The improvement percentages of coastlines by the satellite imagery range from 50{\%} to 97{\%} at 41 of the 44 atolls. We establish a webpage for free access to the optical and depth images, and the depth and gravity grids. We will continue to update satellite images, altimeter-derived gravity grids and bathymetric models over major atolls of the SCS.},

Sensitivity experiments with increasing complexity in ocean-atmosphere-wave coupled exchange processes are performed to assess the impacts of coupling on the predictions of the atmosphere, ocean, and wave environments during the occurrence of a TC. Modest improvement in track but significant improvement in intensity are found when using the fully atmosphere-ocean-wave coupled configuration versus uncoupled (e.g., standalone atmosphere, ocean, or wave) model simulations. Surface wave fields generated in the fully coupled configuration also demonstrates good agreement with in situ buoy measurements. Coupled and uncoupled model-simulated sea surface temperature (SST) fields are compared with both in situ and remote observations. Detailed heat budget analysis reveals that the mixed layer temperature cooling in the deep ocean (on the shelf) is caused primarily by advection (equally by advection and diffusion).},

abstract = {The AMANDES project aims to study transports from the Andean mountains to the Atlantic Ocean through the Amazon system. This requires realistic estuarine modelling in this area strongly forced by tides and river discharge. As none of the existing models for this region would fit the actual needs of the project, a specific new generation model has been implemented. The model is based on the hydrodynamic finite element model T-UGOm. In a first step, we limit our investigations to tidal dynamics. As the Amazon estuary is a very shallow macro-tidal area, it is necessary to improve the available bathymetries and to develop a precise bottom friction parametrisation. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of a high resolution regional model. This allows us to develop a precise and accurate tidal model: for instance, the overall root mean square error on complex differences is reduced from 54 cm in a standard model to 27 cm in our best model. Such precise and accurate tidal modelling is a prerequisite for modelling particle transport. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To better understand how individual processes combine to cause flooding and erosion events, we investigate the relative contribution of tides, waves, and nontidal residuals to extreme total water levels (TWLs) at the shoreline of U.S. West Coast sandy beaches. Extreme TWLs, defined as the observed annual maximum event and the simulated 100 year return level event, peak in Washington, and are on average larger in Washington and Oregon than in California. The relative contribution of wave-induced and still water levels (SWL) to the 100 year TWL event is similar to that of the annual maximum event; however, the contribution of storm surge to the SWL doubles across events. Understanding the regional variability of TWLs will lead to a better understanding of how sea level rise, changes in storminess, and possible changes in the frequency of major El Ni{\~{n}}os may impact future coastal flooding and erosion along the U.S. West Coast and elsewhere.},

abstract = {Coastal tides are influenced by several factors and one of the most important of these is the character of the adjacent continental shelf. A continental margin theory is derived and used to discuss several different aspects of the effect "smooth" continental shelves have on tides. The main results are as follows. (a) The theory suggests, in accordance with observations, that semi-diurnal tides should be amplified on wide shelves in mid and low latitudes, but that diurnal tides should not be amplified. (b) Continental shelf tidal resonance occurs when the shelf scale (g$\alpha$/($\omega$2-f2)($\alpha$=shelf bottom slope, $\omega$ = tidal frequency) is approximately equal to the shelf width. Theoretical arguments and observation can be used to show that shelf resonance occurs, for example, along sections of the northwest Australian shelf. (c) Given the easily obtained coastal tide, theory shows that tides over the continental shelf and slope can be approximately estimated analytically. Calculations using simple prediction formulae can be made on a hand calculator. Subject to some restrictions, a simple and inexpensive method is thus available for estimating barotropic tides on continental shelves. (d) An appropriate boundary condition for global numerical tidal models, which cannot resolve the continental margin region, is derived. For the diurnal tides, the boundary condition can be well approximated by an impermeable wall condition at the deep-sea continental slope boundary. For the semi-diurnal tides, the impermeable wall condition usually, but not always, suffices; it can break down on wide continental shelves. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {Planning community resilience to sea level rise (SLR) requires information about where, when, and how SLR hazards will impact the coastal zone. We augment passive flood mapping (the so-called “bathtub” approach) by simulating physical processes posing recurrent threats to coastal infrastructure, communities, and ecosystems in Hawai‘i (including tidally-forced direct marine and groundwater flooding, seasonal wave inundation, and chronic coastal erosion). We find that the “bathtub” approach, alone, ignores 35–54 percent of the total land area exposed to one or more of these hazards, depending on location and SLR scenario. We conclude that modeling dynamic processes, including waves and erosion, is essential to robust SLR vulnerability assessment. Results also indicate that as sea level rises, coastal lands are exposed to higher flood depths and water velocities. The prevalence of low-lying coastal plains leads to a rapid increase in land exposure to hazards when sea level exceeds a critical elevation of {\~{}}0.3 or 0.6 m, depending on location. At {\~{}}1 m of SLR, land that is roughly seven times the total modern beach area is exposed to one or more hazards. Projected increases in extent, magnitude, and rate of persistent SLR impacts suggest an urgency to engage in long-term planning immediately.},

abstract = {Tsunamis generated by earthquakes involve physical processes of different temporal and spatial scales that extend across the ocean to the shore. This paper presents a shock-capturing dispersive wave model in the spherical coordinate system for basin-wide evolution and coastal run-up of tsunamis and discusses the implementation of a two-way grid-nesting scheme to describe the wave dynamics at resolution compatible to the physical processes. The depth-integrated model describes dispersive waves through the non-hydrostatic pressure and vertical velocity, which also account for tsunami generation from dynamic seafloor deformation. The semi-implicit, finite difference model captures flow discontinuities associated with bores or hydraulic jumps through the momentum-conserved advection scheme with an upwind flux approximation. The two-way grid-nesting scheme utilizes the Dirichlet condition of the non-hydrostatic pressure and both the horizontal velocity and surface elevation at the inter-grid boundary to ensure propagation of dispersive waves and discontinuities across computational grids of different resolution. The inter-grid boundary can adapt to bathymetric features to model nearshore wave transformation processes at optimal resolution and computational efficiency. A coordinate transformation enables application of the model to small geographic regions or laboratory experiments with a Cartesian grid. A depth-dependent Gaussian function smoothes localized bottom features in relation to the water depth while retaining the bathymetry important for modeling of tsunami transformation and run-up. Numerical experiments of solitary wave propagation and N-wave run-up verify the implementation of the grid-nesting scheme. The 2009 Samoa Tsunami provides a case study to confirm the validity and effectiveness of the modeling approach for tsunami research and impact assessment. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Temporal variability of the internal tide has been inferred from the 23 year long combined records of the TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, and Jason-2 satellite altimeters by combining harmonic analysis with an analysis of along-track wavenumber spectra of sea-surface height (SSH). Conventional harmonic analysis is first applied to estimate and remove the stationary components of the tide at each point along the reference ground tracks. The wavenumber spectrum of the residual SSH is then computed, and the variance in a neighborhood around the wavenumber of the mode-1 baroclinic M2 tide is interpreted as the sum of noise, broadband nontidal processes, and the nonstationary tide. At many sites a bump in the spectrum associated with the internal tide is noted, and an empirical model for the noise and nontidal processes is used to estimate the nonstationary semidiurnal tidal variance. The results indicate a spatially inhomogeneous pattern of tidal variability. Nonstationary tides are larger than stationary tides throughout much of the equatorial Pacific and Indian Oceans.},

abstract = {Advanced numerical models used to predict coastal change at a variety of time and spatial scales often contain many free parameters that require calibration to the available field data. At present, little guidance (beyond the adoption of the default values provided) is available in the field of coastal engineering to inform the selection of best-fit parameter values. Common calibration techniques can often lack a rigorous quantification of model sensitivity to parameters and parameter-induced model uncertainty. Here we employ the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) method to address these issues. The GLUE method uses Monte Carlo sampling to assess the skill of many different combinations of model parameters when compared to observational data. As a rigorous modelling framework, the GLUE method provides a series of standard tools that assist the modeller to analyse model sensitivity, undertake parameter optimisation and quantify parameter-induced uncertainty. In addition, new tools are presented here to identify where unique calibrated parameter sets are required for different observational data (e.g., should the calibrated parameter set differ between alongshore locations at a site) and investigate the convergence of GLUE estimated optimum parameter values over increasing numbers of Monte Carlo samples. As the methodology and philosophy of GLUE is well established in other fields, this paper presents a practical case study to explore the strengths and weaknesses of the method when applied to a relatively complex coastal numerical model (XBeach). The results obtained are compared to a previously reported and more ‘standard' model calibration undertaken within the context of a coastal storm early warning system. While the GLUE method requires orders of magnitude more computational power, it is shown that its use in place of the more common one-at-a-time ‘trial-and-error' approach to model calibration, provides: a significant improvement in predictive skill; a more rigorous evaluation of the model sensitivity to parameters; the ability to identify distinct differences in the XBeach model performance dependent on dune impact processes; and additional analysis including the quantification of parameter-induced uncertainty.},

abstract = {We assess the suitability of ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) data for the global modeling of tropical cyclone (TC) storm surges. We extract meteorological forcing from the IFS at a 0.225° horizontal resolution for eight historical TCs and simulate the corresponding surges using the global tide and surge model. Maximum surge heights for Hurricanes Irma and Sandy are compared with tide gauge observations, with R 2-values of 0.86 and 0.74 respectively. Maximum surge heights for the other TCs are in line with literature. Our case studies demonstrate that a horizontal resolution of 0.225° is sufficient for the large-scale modeling of TC surges. By upscaling the meteorological forcing to coarser resolutions as low as 1.0°, we assess the effects of horizontal resolution on the performance of surge modeling. We demonstrate that coarser resolutions result in lower-modeled surges for all case studies, with modeled surges up to 1 m lower for Irma and Nargis. The largest differences in surges between the different resolutions are found for the TCs with the highest surges. We discuss possible drivers of maximum surge heights (TC size, intensity, and coastal slope and complexity), and find that coastal complexity and slope play a more profound role than TC size and intensity alone. The highest surges are found in areas with complex coastlines (fractal dimension {\textgreater} 1.10) and, in general, shallow coastlines. Our findings show that using high-resolution meteorological forcing is particularly beneficial for areas prone to high TC surges, since these surges are reduced the most in coarse-resolution datasets.},

abstract = {Many previous modelling studies have considered storm-tide and riverine flooding independently, even though joint-probability analysis highlighted significant dependence between extreme rainfall and extreme storm surges in estuarine environments. This study investigates compound flooding by quantifying horizontal and vertical differences in coastal flood risk estimates resulting from a separation of storm-tide and riverine flooding processes. We used an open-source version of the Delft3D model to simulate flood extent and inundation depth due to a storm event that occurred in June 2016 in the Shoalhaven Estuary, south-eastern Australia. Time series of observed water levels and discharge measurements are used to force model boundaries, whereas observational data such as satellite imagery, aerial photographs, tidal gauges and water level logger measurements are used to validate modelling results. The comparison of simulation results including and excluding riverine discharge demonstrated large differences in modelled flood extents and inundation depths. A flood risk assessment accounting only for storm-tide flooding would have underestimated the flood extent of the June 2016 storm event by 30 {\%} (20.5 km2). Furthermore, inundation depths would have been underestimated on average by 0.34 m and by up to 1.5 m locally. We recommend considering storm-tide and riverine flooding processes jointly in estuaries with large catchment areas, which are known to have a quick response time to extreme rainfall. In addition, comparison of different boundary set-ups at the intermittent entrance in Shoalhaven Heads indicated that a permanent opening, in order to reduce exposure to riverine flooding, would increase tidal range and exposure to both storm-tide flooding and wave action.},

abstract = {Abstract The generalized inverse of a regional model is used to estimate barotropic tidal dissipation along the Hawaiian Ridge. The model, based on the linear shallow-water equations, incorporates parameterizations for the dissipation of energy via friction in the bottom boundary layer and form drag due to internal waves generated at topographic slopes. Sea surface height data from 364 orbit cycles of the Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon satellite mission are used to perform inversions at eight diurnal and semidiurnal tidal frequencies. It is estimated that the barotropic M2 tide loses energy at a rate of 19 GW, of which 88{\%} is lost within 250 km of the ridge, presumably via conversion to the internal or baroclinic tide. Uncertainty in the assumed model error and wave drag in the forward model suggest that M2 dissipation values from 18 to 25 GW are consistent with the altimetric observations. Other barotropic tidal constituents are estimated to lose a total of 5.7 GW. The spatial distribution ...},

@article{LeBars2016,
abstract = {With the second largest outflow in the world and one of the widest hydrological basins, the Congo River is of a major importance both locally and globally. However, relatively few studies have been conducted on its hydrology, as compared to other great rivers such as the Amazon, Nile, Yangtze, or Mississippi. The goal of this study is therefore to help fill this gap and provide the first high-resolution simulation of the Congo river-estuary-coastal sea continuum. To this end, we are using a discontinuous-Galerkin finite element marine model that solves the two-dimensional depth-averaged shallow water equations on an unstructured mesh. To ensure a smooth transition from river to coastal sea, we have considered a model that encompasses both hydrological and coastal ocean processes. An important difficulty in setting up this model was to find data to parameterize and validate it, as it is a rather remote and understudied area. Therefore, an important effort in this study has been to establish a methodology to take advantage of all the data sources available including nautical charts that had to be digitalized. The model surface elevation has then been validated with respect to an altimetric database. Model results suggest the existence of gyres in the vicinity of the river mouth that have never been documented before. The effect of those gyres on the Congo River dynamics has been further investigated by simulating the transport of Lagrangian particles and computing the water age. {\&}copy; 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018. The Authors. We apply a coupled circulation-wave model to simulate extreme sea levels induced by tropical cyclones at the basin scale. We quantify storm tides, surges, waves, and their interactions for historical tropical cyclones (1988-2015) in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Comparisons between model results and field observations along the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts indicate that the overall performance of the model is satisfactory, with a root-mean-square error, bias, and Willmott skill of, respectively, 0.31, -0.04 m, and 0.9 for storm tides and 1.94 m, -0.22 m, and 0.87 for significant wave heights. Model results show that the highest surge levels were generated in Western Long Island Sound and NY/NJ Harbor, along the coasts of the Carolinas and Southwest Florida, near the Mississippi River delta, and along the coasts of Louisiana and East Texas. We find that the nonlinear tide-surge interaction is often significant, but its contribution to peak storm tides induced by the most extreme events (i.e., storms that caused storm tides larger than 2 m) was moderate (-12{\%} to 5{\%}). We find that the maximum wave setup was relatively large (tens of cm) in most coastal regions, but it did not necessarily coincide with the peak storm tide. The contribution of wave setup to peak storm tides induced by the most extreme events was less than 17{\%}. Finally, we show that while some offshore storms did not affect the coastal areas with high storm surges or strong winds, they generated the largest historical wave setup at the coast.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Basel.The March 2011 Great East Japan Tsunami was one of the most disastrous tsunami events on record, affecting the east coast of Japan to an extreme degree. Extensive currents combined with flow depths in inundation zones account for this devastating impact. Video footage taken by the eyewitnesses reveals the destructive effect and dragging capability of strong tsunami currents along the coast. This study provides a numerical modeling study in Kamaishi Bay, calculating the damage inflicted by tsunami waves on structures and coastlines in terms of the square of the Froude number Fr2; and also other calculated hydrodynamic parameters, such as the distribution of instantaneous flow depths, maximum currents and water surface elevations that occurred during this catastrophic tsunami. Analyses were performed by using the tsunami numerical modeling code NAMI DANCE with nested domains at a higher resolution. The effect of the Kamaishi breakwater on the tsunami inundation distance and coastal damage was tested by using the conditions of "with breakwater," "without breakwater," and "damaged breakwater." Results show that the difference between the hydrostatic pressure on the seaward side of the breakwater and the leeward side of the breakwater is quite high, clarifying conditions contributing to failure of the breakwater. Lower water surface elevations were calculated in the case of a breakwater existing at the entrance, a partly valid condition for the damaged breakwater case. The results are different for current velocities and Frmax2 in the "with breakwater" condition due to the concentration of energy through the breakwater gaps.},

The generation of tsunamis by submarine mass failure had been considered a rare phenomenon which had aroused virtually no attention in terms of tsunami hazard mitigation. We report on recently acquired high-resolution seismic reflection data which yield new images of a large underwater slump, coincident with photographic and bathymetric evidence of the same feature, suspected of having generated the tsunami. T-phase records from an unblocked hydrophone at Wake Island provide new evidence for the timing of the slump. By merging geological data with hydrodynamic modelling, we reproduce the observed tsunami amplitude and timing in a manner consistent with eyewitness accounts. Submarine mass failure is predicted based on fundamental geological and geotechnical information.},

@article{Blain1994,
abstract = {The influence of domain size on boundary condition specification and on computed storm surge response is investigated. Storm surge response along the Florida shelf in the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricane Kate is examined over three domains using two different open ocean boundary forcing functions, a still water (or zero elevation) condition and an inverted barometer condition which accounts for the atmospheric pressure component of the meteorological forcing. The first domain is relatively small and is situated primarily on the continental shelf in the region of intense storm surge generation. A second domain includes the entire Gulf of Mexico basin. The final domain covers the Gulf of Mexico, contiguous basins, and extends out into the deep Atlantic Ocean. The computed storm surge response indicates that the small domain is inadequate, since cross-shelf boundaries are in regions of significant storm surge generation where surge and therefore boundary conditions are not known a priori. Also, the behavior of resonant modes that are physically excited within the Gulf of Mexico due to the passage of the hurricane is unknown at the boundaries of this small domain. The domain that includes the entire Gulf of Mexico captures the primary storm surge well but may not correctly model resonant modes. In general, these resonant modes are difficult to accurately set up by boundary condition specification, since they may be dependent on interactions between the Gulf and contiguous basins. The primary storm surge response as well as resonant modes excited by the storm are best represented using a domain which encompasses the western North Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. This domain with deep Atlantic Ocean boundaries facilitates simple boundary condition specification and minimizes the influence of boundary conditions on storm surge generation in coastal regions. Basin resonant modes and basin to basin interactions are also captured.},

In this paper we present a new method based on a "local" eigenexpansion to estimate the spectrum in terms of the solution of an integral equation. Computationally this method is equivalent to using the weishted average of a series of direct-spectrum estimates based on orthogonal data windows (discrete prolate spheroidal sequences) to treat both the bias and smoothing problems. Some of the attractive features of this estimate are: there are no arbitrary windows; it is a small sample theory; it is consistent; it provides an analysis-of-variance test for line components; and it has high resolution. We also show relations of this estimate to maximum-likelihood estimates, show that the estimation capacity of the estimate is high, and show applications to coherence and polyspectrum estimates.},

abstract = {A brief summary of Delaunay unstructured triangular grid refinement algorithms, including the recent "off-centers" method, is provided and mesh generation requirements that are imperative to meet the criteria of the circulation modeling community are defined. A Matlab public-domain two-dimensional (2-D) mesh generation package (BatTri) based on these requirements is then presented and its efficiency shown through examples. BatTri consists of a graphical mesh editing interface and several bathymetry-based refinement algorithms, complemented by a set of diagnostic utilities to check and improve grid quality. The final output mesh node locations, node depths and element incidence list are obtained starting from only a basic set of bathymetric data. This simple but efficient setup allows fast interactive mesh customization and provides circulation modelers with problem-specific flexibility while satisfying the usual requirements on mesh size and element quality. A test of the "off-centers" method performed on 100 domains with randomly generated coastline and bathymetry shows an overall 25{\%} reduction in the number of elements with only slight decrease in element quality. More importantly, this shows that BatTri is easily upgradeable to meet the future demands by the addition of new grid generation algorithms and Delaunay refinement schemes as they are made available. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The weather research and forecast (WRF) model downscaling skill in extreme maximum daily temperature is evaluated by using the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. While the GEV distribution has been used extensively in climatology and meteorology for estimating probabilities of extreme events, accurately estimating GEV parameters based on data from a single pixel can be difficult, even with fairly long data records. This work proposes a simple method assuming that the shape parameter, the most difficult of the three parameters to estimate, does not vary over a relatively large region. This approach is applied to evaluate 31-year WRF-downscaled extreme maximum temperature through comparison with North American regional reanalysis (NARR) data. Uncertainty in GEV parameter estimates and the statistical significance in the differences of estimates between WRF and NARR are accounted for by conducting a novel bootstrap procedure that makes no assumption of temporal or spatial independence within a year, which is especially important for climate data. Despite certain biases over parts of the United States, overall, WRF shows good agreement with NARR in the spatial pattern and magnitudes of GEV parameter estimates. Both WRF and NARR show a significant increase in extreme maximum temperature over the southern Great Plains and southeastern United States in January and over the western United States in July. The GEV model shows clear benefits from the regionally constant shape parameter assumption, for example, leading to estimates of the location and scale parameters of the model that show coherent spatial patterns.},

abstract = {In light of the recent enhanced activity in the study of tsunami waves and their source mechanisms, we consider tsunami-like waves that are induced by atmospheric processes rather than by seismic sources. These waves are mainly associated with atmospheric gravity waves, pressure jumps, frontal passages, squalls and other types of atmospheric disturbances, which normally generate barotropic ocean waves in the open ocean and amplify them near the coast through specific resonance mechanisms (Proudman, Greenspan, shelf, harbour). The main purpose of the present study is to describe this hazardous phenomenon, to show similarities and differences between seismic and meteorological tsunamis and to provide an overview of meteorological tsunamis in the World Ocean. It is shown that tsunamis and meteotsunamis have the same periods, same spatial scales, similar physical properties and affect the coast in a comparably destructive way. Some specific features of meteotsunamis make them akin to landslide-generated tsunamis. The generation efficiency of both phenomena depend on the Froude number (Fr), with resonance taking place when Fr∼1.0. Meteotsunamis are much less energetic than seismic tsunamis and that is why they are always local, while seismic tsunamis can have globally destructive effects. Destructive meteotsunamis are always the result of a combination of several resonant factors; the low probability of such a combination is the main reason why major meteotsunamis are infrequent and observed only at some specific locations in the ocean.},

Multimodel ensembles using the phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3)/Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A1B (SRES A1B; late-twenty-first century) and phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)/representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5; early- and late-twenty-first century) scenarios are examined. Ten individual CMIP3 models are downscaled to assess the spread of results among the CMIP3 (but not the CMIP5) models. Downscaling simulations are compared for 18-kmgrid regional and 50-kmgrid globalmodels. Stormcases from the regionalmodel are further downscaled into theGeophysical FluidDynamics Laboratory (GFDL) hurricane model (9-km inner grid spacing, with ocean coupling) to simulate intense hurricanes at a finer resolution. A significant reduction in tropical storm frequency is projected for the CMIP3 (227{\%}), CMIP5-early (220{\%}) and CMIP5-late (223{\%}) ensembles and for 5 of the 10 individual CMIP3 models. Lifetime maximumhurricane intensity increases significantly in the high-resolution experiments-by 4{\%}-6{\%}for CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles. A significant increase (187{\%}) in the frequency of very intense (categories 4 and 5) hurricanes (winds {\$} 59ms21) is projected using CMIP3, but smaller, only marginally significant increases are projected (145{\%}and 139{\%}) for the CMIP5-early and CMIP5-late scenarios. Hurricane rainfall rates increase robustly for the CMIP3 and CMIP5 scenarios. For the late-twenty-first century, this increase amounts to120{\%} to 130{\%}in the model hurricane's inner core, with a smaller increase (;10{\%}) for averaging radii of 200km or larger. The fractional increase in precipitation at large radii (200-400 km) approximates that expected from environmental water vapor content scaling, while increases for the inner core exceed this level. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

To cure this in practical calculations, various limiters on the source terms are often employed. In the present work, a mathematically correct bound for eddy viscosity is obtained from the realizability condition itself. From this, realizability bounds for several terms of model equations are given. The effects of various bounds including the present one, are investigated on the predictions of fundamental flows including simple shear flows, supersonic compression ramp flow and supersonic base flow.

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to find a combination of optimal numerical algorithms for time-stepping and mode-splitting suitable for a high-resolution, free-surface, terrain-following coordinate oceanic model. Due to mathematical feedback between the baroclinic momentum and tracer equations and, similarly, between the barotropic momentum and continuity equations, it is advantageous to treat both modes so that, after a time step for the momentum equation, the computed velocities participate immediately in the computation of tracers and continuity, and vice versa, rather than advancing all equations for one time step simultaneously. This leads to a new family of time-stepping algorithms that combine forward-backward feedback with the best known synchronous algorithms, allowing an increased time step due to the enhanced internal stability without sacrificing its accuracy. Based on these algorithms we design a split-explicit hydrodynamic kernel for a realistic oceanic model, which addresses multiple numerical issues associated with mode splitting. This kernel utilizes consistent temporal averaging of the barotropic mode via a specially designed filter function to guarantee both exact conservation and constancy preservation properties for tracers and yields more accurate (up to second-order), resolved barotropic processes, while preventing aliasing of unresolved barotropic signals into the slow baroclinic motions. It has a more accurate mode-splitting due to redefined barotropic pressure-gradient terms to account for the local variations in density field, while maintaining the computational efficiency of a split model. It is naturally compatible with a variety of centered and upstream-biased high-order advection algorithms, and helps to mitigate computational cost of expensive physical parameterization of mixing processes and submodels. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The semidiurnal tidal energy flows from the SCS to the JS through the Karimata Strait and the eastern part of the southern Natuna Sea but flows in the opposite direction in the Gaspar Strait and the western part of the southern Natuna Sea. Harmonic analysis of sea level and current observation also suggest that the study area is located in the antinodal band of the diurnal tidal waves, and in the nodal band of the semidiurnal tidal waves.

@article{Slobbe2013,
abstract = {Current and new applications of 2D storm surge models such as the Dutch Continental Shelf Model (DCSM) require that the models provide proper estimates of the instantaneous water levels expressed relative to a particular geoid, rather than only the tide and surge components expressed relative to the ill-defined model's zero height surface. For DCSM, this is realized by adding the depth-averaged horizontal baroclinic pressure gradients to the model equations, which are derived from 4D salinity and temperature fields provided by the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory hydrodynamic model (POL's hindcast). The vertical datum of the extended model is fixed to that of the European Gravimetric Geoid model 2008 (EGG08). This is done by an adjustment of the model parameters that depend on the choice of the reference surface (e.g., bathymetry) and by referring the water levels along the open boundaries to this reference surface. Using different numerical experiments we investigate the effects on the water levels of several approximations we have made during the implementation. The ability of the model to reproduce both the mean sea level (MSL) and instantaneous water levels is assessed by a comparison with the MSL derived from POL's hindcast as well as with instantaneous water levels acquired by various radar altimeter satellites. From this comparison we conclude that our modeled MSL is in good agreement with the MSL derived from POL's hindcast; the standard deviation of the differences is below 2. cm. However, larger differences in MSL are observed when comparing the model output with the MSL derived from radar altimeter data. They are attributed to either geoid errors or errors in the used salinity and temperature fields. The root mean squared (rms) differences between observed and modeled instantaneous water levels over the entire model domain varies from 9. cm for data acquired by the TOPEX satellite to 11. cm for data acquired by the GFO-1 satellite. These numbers improve to 8-10. cm on the North Sea, for data acquired by the TOPEX and ERS-2 satellites, respectively. These numbers are a factor two to three larger than the expected accuracy of water levels derived from radar altimeter data (which is {\~{}}4 cm). About 25{\%} of these differences can be explained by a bias between the modeled and observed water levels of a single satellite pass. These biases are attributed to errors in the applied correction for the net steric expansion/contraction of the global oceans as this is not captured by DCSM that makes use of the Boussinesq approximation, as well as other errors in model and data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The observed SL fluctuations are known to manifest a power law scaling. We have checked if the SL changes simulated in the AOGCM exhibit the same scaling properties and the long-term correlations as observed in the tide gauge records. We find that the majority of AOGCMs overestimates the scaling of SL fluctuations, particularly in the North Atlantic. Consequently, AOGCMs, routinely used to project regional SL rise, may underestimate the part of the externally driven SL rise, in particular the anthropogenic footprint, in the projections for the 21st century.},

In the context of tsunami generation and propagation over trans-oceanic distances, a scaling analysis reveals that the importance of frequency dispersion increases with a decrease of the source width, while the effect of the Coriolis force increases with an increase of the source width. A sensitivity analysis to dispersive and Coriolis effects is carried out using the numerical model in a series of numerical experiments in an idealized ocean using Gaussian and di-polar sources with different source sizes. A simulation of the Tohoku 2011 tsunami is used to illustrate the effects of dispersive and Coriolis effects at large distances from the source region.},

abstract = {Abyssal hills are the dominant small-scale roughness fabric over much of the ocean floor. Created at mid-ocean ridges by combined volcanic and tectonic processes, they are rafted away by plate spreading and modified through time by mass wasting and sedimentation. Abyssal hills are morphological indicators of spreading rate and direction: they are lineated parallel to the ridge at the time of formation, and their heights and widths are inversely correlated to spreading rate. Knowledge of abyssal hill roughness statistics is important for high-resolution models, including models of internal wave generation and mixing driven by tidal and low-frequency flows over the rough bottom. In this paper we present a prediction of abyssal hill roughness statistical parameters world-wide via relationships for the average statistical properties of abyssal hills as a function of spreading rate and direction, and for the modification to these roughness parameters as a function of sediment thickness. These relationships are constrained by new publicly-available digital maps of paleo-spreading rate and direction, and sediment thickness. We also develop a new method for generating synthetic topography with variable statistical properties over a grid, and present an example of synthetic abyssal hill roughness generated for the North Atlantic on a 1/2-min grid.},

Tsunami phenomena involve a large span of spatial and temporal scales-from ocean basin scales of [Formula: see text] to local coastal wave interactions of [Formula: see text] or even [Formula: see text], or from resonating wave phenomena with durations of [Formula: see text] to rupture with time periods of [Formula: see text]. The scale gap of five orders of magnitude in each dimension makes accurate modelling very demanding, with a number of approaches being taken to work around the impossibility of direct numerical simulations. Along with the mentioned multi-scale characteristic, the tsunami wave has a multitude of different phases, corresponding to different wave regimes and associated equation sets. While in the deep ocean, wave propagation can be approximated relatively accurately by linear shallow-water theory, the transition to a bore or solitary wave train in shelf areas and then into a breaking wave in coastal regions demands appropriate mathematical and numerical treatments. The short duration and unpredictability of tsunami events pose another challenging requirement to tsunami simulation approaches. An accurate forecast is sought within seconds with very limited data available. Thus, efficiency in numerical solution processes and at the same time the consideration of uncertainty play a big role in tsunami modelling applied for forecasting purposes.},

abstract = {Compound events (CEs) are weather and climate events that result from multiple hazards or drivers with the potential to cause severe socio-economic impacts. Compared with isolated hazards, the multiple hazards/drivers associated with CEs can lead to higher economic losses and death tolls. Here, we provide the first analysis of multiple multivariate CEs potentially causing high-impact floods, droughts, and fires. Using observations and reanalysis data during 1980–2014, we analyse 27 hazard pairs and provide the first spatial estimates of their occurrences on the global scale. We identify hotspots of multivariate CEs including many socio-economically important regions such as North America, Russia and western Europe. We analyse the relative importance of different multivariate CEs in six continental regions to highlight CEs posing the highest risk. Our results provide initial guidance to assess the regional risk of CE events and an observationally-based dataset to aid evaluation of climate models for simulating multivariate CEs.},

abstract = {This study presents a new approach to assess storm surge risk from tropical cyclones under climate change by direct calculation of the local flood levels using a limited number of events with an associated probability. The approach is based on the near-worst-case flood scenario, associated with a known tropical cyclone wind intensity probability (return period). We applied the method for the locality of Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico, using synthetic tropical cyclones derived from six different general circulation models for the present and future climates under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. The synthetic events allowed the characterization of the wind intensity for the present and future climates for a given return period, as well as to determine the key tropical cyclones parameters related to storm surge. For Hurricane Patricia (2015), the strongest tropical cyclone to impact the region, we determined that its 95 m/s winds have a return period above 4000 years for the present climate and 198 years in a future climate scenario. Using Hurricane Patricia's peak wind intensity, we created hypothetical events representing all possible approaches of tropical cyclones (211 events) to Manzanillo. We forced a hydrodynamic model with the hypothetical events over a mesh created with LiDAR-derived topography and then calculated the storm surge to create the near-worst-case flood scenario based on the maximum envelopes of water (MEOWs) and the maximum of MEOWs. Using those results, we created flood risk maps at city block level based on the combination of flood hazard and socioeconomic vulnerability maps. The presented method provides a tool for tropical cyclones storm surge hazard and risk assessment by generating near-worst-case flood maps under projected climates using a limited set of hypothetical events.},

The roller is considered as a volume of water being carried by the wave with the wave celerity. The effect of the roller is included in the vertical distribution of the horizontal velocity, which leads to an additional convective momentum term. The breaking criterion is related to the local slope of water surface and the thickness of the roller is determined from simple geometrical considerations. Although the model is simple, it is capable of representing a variety of processes such as the initiation and cessation of wave breaking, the evolution of wave profiles before, during and after wave breaking, the initial conversion of potential energy into forward momentum flux, and the associated horizontal shift between the break point and the point where the setup in mean water level is initiated. Results are presented for regular and irregular wave trains and comparison with measurements shows good agreement.},

abstract = {We provide a general framework for identifying the constituents responsible for asymmetry in any tidal time series, by extending and generalizing the skewness-based approach of Nidzieko (2010) to include any number of tidal constituents. We show that this statistic has two features which greatly simplify the attribution of asymmetry to particular constituents: (1) only combinations of two or three constituents can contribute to skewness, regardless of how many constituents are significant in the time series and (2) of those combinations, only the few meeting the frequency conditions 2 omega(1) = omega(2) or omega(1) + omega(2) = omega(3) will give rise to long-term mean asymmetry. It is therefore relatively easy to identify every such combination, even when many constituents are present. We then go on to show how the relative contribution of each such combination can be measured and compared, based on the amplitudes, frequencies and relative phases of the constituents. We also show that there is an upper bound to the skewness generated by any such combination. The metrics are applied to data from 335 worldwide sea level stations and from a global ocean tidal model based on TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetry. Global maps are made of the patterns of tidal skewness. We identify the combinations of astronomical tides that dominate skewness in different tidal regimes and geographic locations, and explain the dependence of skewness on tidal form number.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers. The mathematical modeling of the interaction of water waves with porous coastal structures has continuously been among the most relevant challenges in coastal engineering research and practice. Finding a tool to better predict essential processes, relevant to the functionality and stability of breakwaters and jetties, and how they are affected by permeability, has been hampered by computational limitations that are being overcome. Over the last 60 years, the Journal of Waterway, Port, Coast, and Ocean Engineering has witnessed gradual developments leading from linearized solutions based on wave theories and constant friction coefficients to very sophisticated Eulerian or Lagrangian solvers of the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, including turbulence within porous media. Today, although not without difficulty, the first steps are being made toward addressing the simulation of a fully three-dimensional interaction of complete sea states with porous structures at prototype scale. In this paper, after posing the mathematical foundations of the problem, the solution techniques available in the literature are reviewed. Linear solutions based on potential theory; depth-integrated solutions, including Boussinesq approximations; and solutions based on the NS equations, in both the Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks, are covered. Then, turbulence modeling on porous media is discussed. Conclusions and a discussion of future research directions close the paper. It is shown that, after so many years, some fundamental questions still remain unanswered, leaving challenges open for future research.},

abstract = {Deep convection possesses markedly distinct properties at different spatiotemporal scales.We present an original high-resolution (4 km, hourly) unified data product of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and isolated deep convection (IDC) in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains and examine their climatological characteristics from 2004 to 2017. The data product is produced by applying an updated Flexible Object Tracker algorithm to hourly satellite brightness temperature, radar reflectivity, and precipitation datasets. Analysis of the data product shows that MCSs are much larger and longer-lasting than IDC, but IDC occurs about 100 times more frequently than MCSs, with a mean convective intensity comparable to that of MCSs. Hence both MCS and IDC are essential contributors to precipitation east of the Rocky Mountains, although their precipitation shows significantly different spatiotemporal characteristics. IDC precipitation concentrates in summer in the Southeast with a peak in the late afternoon, while MCS precipitation is significant in all seasons, especially for spring and summer in the Great Plains. The spatial distribution of MCS precipitation amounts varies by season, while diurnally, MCS precipitation generally peaks during nighttime except in the Southeast. Potential uncertainties and limitations of the data product are also discussed. The data product is useful for investigating the atmospheric environments and physical processes associated with different types of convective systems; quantifying the impacts of convection on hydrology, atmospheric chemistry, and severe weather events; and evaluating and improving the representation of convective processes in weather and climate models.

The tidal energy budget and tidal energy fluxes in the GoM are calculated from the simulations. Results show that diurnal tides in the GoM are dominantly due to co-oscillation with the western Atlantic and that a substantial amount of semidiurnal tidal energy also enters the Gulf through the straits. Model experiments suggest that adding the local tidal potential significantly modifies the propagation of the semidiurnal tidal signal within the GoM and reduces the tidal power associated with the diurnal tides in the basin. An interesting phenomenon of nonlinear interaction between the two forcing mechanisms (local forcing and propagation through the straits) is described and explained by using a mechanistic mass-spring system model.},

abstract = {The ocean tidal velocity and elevation can be estimated concurrently with the ocean circulation by adding the astronomical tidal forcing, parameterized topographic internal wave drag, and self-attraction and loading to the general circulation physics. However, the accuracy of these tidal estimates does not yet match accuracies in the best data-assimilative barotropic tidal models. This paper investigates the application of an augmented state ensemble Kalman Filter (ASEnKF) to improve the accuracy of M2 barotropic tides embedded in a 1/12.5° three-dimensional ocean general circulation model. The ASEnKF is an alternative to the techniques typically used with linearized tide-only models; such techniques cannot be applied to the embedded tides in a nonlinear eddying circulation. An extra term, meant to correct for errors in the tide model due to imperfectly known topography and damping terms, is introduced into the tidal forcing. Ensembles of the model are created with stochastically generated forcing correction terms. The discrepancies for each ensemble member with TPXO, an existing data-assimilative tide model, are computed. The ASEnKF method yields an optimal estimate of the model forcing correction terms, that minimizes resultant root mean square (RMS) tidal sea surface elevation error with respect to TPXO, as well as an estimate of the tidal elevation. The deep-water, global area-averaged RMS sea surface elevation error of the principal lunar semidiurnal tide M2 is reduced from 4.4 cm in a best-case non-assimilative solution to 2.6 cm. The largest elevation errors in both the non-assimilative and ASEnKF solutions are in the North Atlantic, a highly resonant basin. Possible pathways for achieving further reductions in the RMS error are discussed.},

We merged this bathymetry dataset with a high-resolution digital evaluation model, resulting in a novel, consistent product with unprecedented coverage, from the deep parts of the ocean basin (north of 20°N) to the far upstream areas of the delta (around 24°N). This new bathymetry reduces errors in the tidal residuals by a factor of 2–3 for most coastal gauges as compared to global tidal models. The best results are obtained for the Hooghly River, where errors are as low as 6 cm. The improvement in the mouth of the Meghna is moderate, su...},

abstract = {This study provides an overview of the coupled high-resolution Version 1 of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv1) and documents the characteristics of a 50-year-long high-resolution control simulation with time-invariant 1950 forcings following the HighResMIP protocol. In terms of global root-mean-squared error metrics, this high-resolution simulation is generally superior to results from the low-resolution configuration of E3SMv1 (due to resolution, tuning changes, and possibly initialization procedure) and compares favorably to models in the CMIP5 ensemble. Ocean and sea ice simulation is particularly improved, due to better resolution of bathymetry, the ability to capture more variability and extremes in winds and currents, and the ability to resolve mesoscale ocean eddies. The largest improvement in this regard is an ice-free Labrador Sea, which is a major problem at low resolution. Interestingly, several features found to improve with resolution in previous studies are insensitive to resolution or even degrade in E3SMv1. Most notable in this regard are warm bias and associated stratocumulus deficiency in eastern subtropical oceans and lack of improvement in El Ni{\~{n}}o. Another major finding of this study is that resolution increase had negligible impact on climate sensitivity (measured by net feedback determined through uniform +4K prescribed sea surface temperature increase) and aerosol sensitivity. Cloud response to resolution increase consisted of very minor decrease at all levels. Large-scale patterns of precipitation bias were also relatively unaffected by grid spacing.},

abstract = {Forerunner surge, a water level rise ahead of tropical cyclone landfall, often strikes coastal communities unexpectedly, stranding people and increasing loss of life. Surge forecasting systems and emergency managers almost exclusively focus on peak surge, while much less attention is given to forerunner surge. To address the need for fast and accurate forecasting of forerunner surge, we analyze high-fidelity surge simulations in Virginia, New York/New Jersey and Texas and extract physical scaling laws between readily available storm track information and forerunner surge magnitude and timing. We demonstrate that a dimensionless relationship between central-pressure scaled surge and wind-duration scaled time may effectively be used for rapid forerunner surge forecasting, where uncertainty is considered. We use our method to predict forerunner surge for Hurricanes Ike (2008)—a significant forerunner surge event—and Harvey (2017). The predicted forerunner surge 24 to 6 h before Hurricane Ike's landfall ranged from 0.4 to 2.8 m, where the observed forerunner surge ranged from 0.4 to 2.6 m. This new method has the potential to be incorporated into real-time surge forecasting systems to aid emergency management and evacuation decisions.},

abstract = {From almost 7000 near-surface eddy-covariance flux measurements over the sea, the authors deduce a new air-sea drag relation for aerodynamically rough flow: u * = 0.0583U N10-0.243. Here u * is the measured friction velocity, and U N10 is the neutral-stability wind speed at a reference height of 10 m. This relation is fitted to U N10 values between 9 and 24 ms -1.Adrag relation formulated as u * versus UN10 has several advantages over one formulated in terms of CDN10 5(u */U N10) 2. First, the multiplicative coefficient on U N10 has smaller experimental uncertainty than do determinations of CDN10. Second, scatterplots of u * versus UN10 are not ill posed when UN10 is small, as plots of CDN10 are; u *-U N10 plots presented here suggest aerodynamically smooth scaling for small UN10. Third, this relation depends only weakly on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory and, consequently, reduces the confounding effects of artificial correlation. Finally, with its negative intercept, the linear relation produces a CDN10 function that naturally rolls off at high wind speed and asymptotically approaches a constant value of 3.40 3 10 -3. Hurricane modelers and the air-sea interaction community have been trying to rationalize such behavior in the drag coefficient for at least 15 years. This paper suggests that this rolloff in C DN10 results simply from known processes that influence wind-wave coupling. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {This paper and its companion paper (Lara et al. (2012)) describe the capability of a new model, called IH-3VOF, to simulate wave–structure interaction problems using a three-dimensional approach, when porous structures are present. The lack of a universal approach for the formulation of porous media flow equations has motivated a new derivation in the present work. Applications dealing with heterogeneous media, where porosity varies along the porous body, such as the study of multilayered rubble-mound breakwaters, are the final objective of the study. In this first paper, a new derivation of the equations, eliminating the limitations imposed by previous approaches is presented. The model integrates a new set of equations which covers physical processes associated with flow interaction with porous structures. The model considers the multiphase VARANS equations, a volume-averaged version of the traditional RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes) equations. Turbulence is modeled using a k–$\epsilon$ approach, not only at the clear fluid region but also inside the porous media. A VOF technique is used to track the free surface. In this first paper, the model has been validated using laboratory data of a two-dimensional flow. In the companion paper the model is further validated with new experimental data sets, considering porous and solid structures as well as the presence of air. The model predictions present an excellent agreement with the laboratory measurements.},

An analytical approach to estimate the shear stress distribution at the plate is also presented. The flowfield of a three-dimensional wall jet is found to be characterized by three distinct regions in the axis velocity decay. From the results obtained it is concluded that for three-dimensional wall jets the maximum velocity in the flow in the near field exhibits a decay rate dependent on orifice geometry, whereas far downstream of theet exit it decays at the same rate as that in a radial wall jet flow field independent of orifice geometry. Furthermore, it is shown that growth of the mixing layer normal to the plate is apparently independent of orifice shape while the near field spanwise growth is affected by initial geometry.},

@article{Emanuel2001,
abstract = {Tropical cyclones mix warm surface waters with cooler water within the thermocline, leaving pronounced, cold wakes that over a period of weeks are restored to normal conditions by mixing and surface fluxes. This restoration is associated with net, vertically integrated heating of ocean columns, which in statistical equilibrium must be balanced by oceanic heat transport out of the regions affected by the storms. Observed tropical cyclone tracks together with coupled ocean-atmosphere hurricane models are used to estimate the net ocean heating induced by global tropical cyclone activity during one calendar year (1996). This estimate, amounting to (1.4±0.7)×l015 W, represents a substantial fraction of the observed peak poleward heat flux by the oceans, suggesting that tropical cyclones may play an important role in driving the thermohaline circulation and thereby in regulating climate. In particular, the strong sensitivity of tropical cyclone intensity to tropical ocean temperatures in turn implies that the net poleward heat flux by the ocean is sensitive to tropical temperature, reducing tropical climate sensitivity and increasing climate sensitivity at higher latitudes.},

abstract = {Offshore floating wind turbines (OFWTs) present unique aerodynamic analysis challenges. Motion-derived velocity perturbations in the wake necessitate higher-fidelity aerodynamic analysis methods than the ubiquitous momentum balance techniques currently in use. A more physically-sound approach is to model the wake generated by a wind turbine rotor as a freely convecting lattice, using the resultant inflow to estimate rotor loads, as it done with a free vortex wake method (FVM). The FVM code Wake Induced Dynamics Simulator (WInDS) was developed at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst to predict the aerodynamic loading and wake evolution of an OFWT to a higher degree of accuracy than is possible via momentum balance methods. A series of validation cases were conducted to provide some basis for applying WInDS to floating wind turbine cases, for which no aerodynamic experimental data is currently available. The results from these tests show that WInDS is able to accurately predict the aerodynamically-derived loads and wake structures generated by various fixed and rotary-wing cases, and may therefore be applied to more complex cases, like OFWTs, with a degree of confidence. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {During the 1986 Izu-Oshima eruption, various types of lave flows were formed. Those are classified into four : coherent lava flows, overspill lava flows, clastogenic (rootless) lava flows and rheomorphic lava flows. Characteristics of each type are summarized as follows : a) Coherent lava flows. In the later stage of LCI lava flow, coherent lava was observed to be effused from C6 crater. b) Overspill lava flows. The summit eruptions formed a lava lake, from where LA I∿IV lava flows spilt over and flowed down the slope of the cone. c) Clastogenic lava flows. Two clastogenic lava flows, LB I and LB III, were originated from high lava fountains from B fissure vents. Those show relict clast structures, covered by blocks of collapsed scoria cone. d) Rheomorphic lava flow. A rheomorphic lava flow, LB II, was observed to flow down from the scoria cone beside B7 crater two days after the eruption of B fissure vents. Chemical composition of LB II is uniform as SiO{\_}2=57wt{\%}, though LBI, LBIII and most scoria falls from B craters show SiO{\_}2=54wt{\%}, except for the earliest scoria fall showing SiO{\_}2=57wt{\%}.

The comparisons of the modeled storm tide with the NOAA gauge stations from Montauk, NY, Long Island Sound, encompassing New York Harbor, Atlantic City, NJ, to Duck, NC, were in good agreement, with an overall root mean square error and relative error in the order of 15–20 cm and 5{\%}–7{\%}, respectively. Furthermore, using large-scale model outputs as the boundary conditions, a separate sub-grid model that incorporates LIDAR data for the major portion of the New York City was also set up to investigate the detailed inundation process. The model results compared favorably with USGS' Hurricane Sandy Mapper database in terms of its timing, local inundation area, and the depth of the flooding water. The street-level inundation with water bypassing the city building was created and the maximum extent of horizontal inundation was calculated, which was within 30 m of the data-derived estimate by USGS.},

Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes “long term” simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere–ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing.

abstract = {A numerical model of the generation and transoceanic propagation of tsunamis is developed. The model is based on hydrodynamic equations in a spherical coordinate system to account for the spherical nature of the Earth. The model provides a deterministic approach to the description of tsunami waves, and is verified by hindcasting the wave behavior following the Alaskan earthquake of 1964. Results of the computation are compared with field measurements (Wake Island deep-water gage records and results obtained from the numerical model developed previously by Hwang and Divoky, 1970). From these calculations, the excessive damage at Crescent City, California, seems to have resulted in part from the phenomenon of tsunami directionality. Finally, the model is applied to a hypothetical CANNIKIN source (Rat Islands source) and shows that the resulting tsunami energy radiation pattern would be highly directional with the largest wave heights passing through the west-central Pacific.},

abstract = {Data assimilation technique (adjoint method) is applied to study the similarities and the differences between the Ekman (linear) and the Quadratic (nonlinear) bottom friction parameterizations for a two-dimensional tidal model. Two methods are used to treat the bottom friction coefficient (BFC). The first method assumes that the BFC is a constant in the entire computation domain, while the second applies the spatially varying BFCs. The adjoint expressions for the linear and the nonlinear parameterizations and the optimization formulae for the two BFC methods are derived based on the typical Largrangian multiplier method. By assimilating the model-generated 'observations', identical twin experiments are performed to test and validate the inversion ability of the presented methodology. Four experiments, which employ the linear parameterization, the nonlinear parameterizations, the constant BFC and the spatially varying BFC, are carried out to simulate the M2 tide in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea by assimilating the TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry and tidal gauge data. After the assimilation, the misfit between model-produced and observed data is significantly decreased in the four experiments. The simulation results indicate that the nonlinear Quadratic parameterization is more accurate than the linear Ekman parameterization if the traditional constant BFC is used. However, when the spatially varying BFCs are used, the differences between the Ekman and the Quadratic approaches diminished, the reason of which is analyzed from the viewpoint of dissipation rate caused by bottom friction. Generally speaking, linear bottom friction parameterizations are often used in global tidal models. This study indicates that they are also applicable in regional ocean tidal models with the combination of spatially varying parameters and the adjoint method. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

This work aims to: (1) study the characteristics of spatially varying BFCs in BYECS; and (2) find out the possible sources and mechanisms of spatially varying BFCs. In the numerical experiment, the M2 tide is simulated and the spatially varying BFCs in BYECS are estimated by assimilating observations from tidal gauge stations and multi-mission altimeters. The simulated M2 tide matches well with the tide gauge data, indicating the reasonability of present methodology of spatially varying BFCs. The characteristics and possible mechanisms of the spatially varying BFCs in BYECS are concluded and discussed, and the main conclusions include: (1) the values of BFCs in shallow water are usually larger than those in deep water, which can reach the order of 10−2 in shallow areas; (2) the values of BFCs generally decrease with the strengthened depth-averaged tidal current velocity in BYECS; (3) the high-value BFC areas near the coasts always appear in the downstream sides of headlands or peninsulas, which are possibly caused by the propagation of tidal waves; (4) the high-value BFC area along Jiangsu coast is affected by the bottom morphology of radially distributed tidal sand ridges, which might enhance the form drag; (5) the high-value BFC areas in the middle of the South Yellow Sea and Fujian coast correspond to the muddy areas, where the mixture of different sediment types changes the bottom roughness.},

The method is validated using all 2003 and 2004 Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico hurricanes. The results show that 6- and 12-h forecast winds using the asymmetric hurricane wind model are statistically more accurate than using a symmetric wind model. Detailed case studies were conducted for four historical hurricanes, namely, Floyd (1999), Gordon (2000), Lily (2002), and Isabel (2003). Although the asymmetric model performed generally better than the symmetric model, the improvement in hurricane wind forecasts produced by the asymmetric model varied significantly for different storms. In some cases, optimizing the symmetric model using observations available at initial time and forecast mean radius of maximum wind can produce comparable wind accuracy measured in terms of rms error of wind speed. However, in order to describe the asymmetric structure of hurricane winds, an asymmetric model is needed.},

abstract = {Two algorithms based on machine learning neural networks are proposed—the shallow learning (S-L) and deep learning (D-L) algorithms—that can potentially be used in atmosphere-only typhoon forecast models to provide flow-dependent typhoon-induced sea surface temperature cooling (SSTC) for improving typhoon predictions. The major challenge of existing SSTC algorithms in forecast models is how to accurately predict SSTC induced by an upcoming typhoon, which requires information not only from historical data but more importantly also from the target typhoon itself. The S-L algorithm composes of a single layer of neurons with mixed atmospheric and oceanic factors. Such a structure is found to be unable to represent correctly the physical typhoon-ocean interaction. It tends to produce an unstable SSTC distribution, for which any perturbations may lead to changes in both SSTC pattern and strength. The D-L algorithm extends the neural network to a 4 × 5 neuron matrix with atmospheric and oceanic factors being separated in different layers of neurons, so that the machine learning can determine the roles of atmospheric and oceanic factors in shaping the SSTC. Therefore, it produces a stable crescent-shaped SSTC distribution, with its large-scale pattern determined mainly by atmospheric factors (e.g., winds) and small-scale features by oceanic factors (e.g., eddies). Sensitivity experiments reveal that the D-L algorithms improve maximum wind intensity errors by 60–70{\%} for four case study simulations, compared to their atmosphere-only model runs.},

A Green–Nagdhi type polynomial expansion is used to resolve the pressure profile along the vertical axis, this is then inserted into the pressure-Poisson equation, retaining terms up to a prescribed order and solved using a weighted residual approach. The model shows rapid convergence properties with increasing order of polynomial expansion which can be greatly improved through the application of asymptotic rearrangement. Models of Boussinesq scaling of the fully nonlinear O($\mu$2) and weakly nonlinear O($\mu$N) are presented, the analytical and numerical properties of O($\mu$2) and O($\mu$4) models are discussed. Optimal basis functions in the Green–Nagdhi expansion are determined through manipulation of the free-parameters which arise due to the Boussinesq scaling. The optimal O($\mu$2) model has dispersion accuracy equivalent to a Pad{\'{e}} [2,2] approximation with one extra free-parameter. The optimal O($\mu$4) model obtains dispersion accuracy equivalent to a Pad{\'{e}} [4,4] approximation with two free-parameters which can be used to optimize shoaling or nonlinear properties. In comparison to experimental results the O($\mu$4) model shows excellent agreement to experimental data.},

Then, a series of North and Equatorial Atlantic configurations are used to show that an increase of the horizontal resolution from eddy-resolving to submesoscale-enabled together with the inclusion of high-resolution bathymetry and tides significantly improve the models' abilities to represent the observed ocean variability and western boundary currents. However, the computational cost of these simulations is extremely large, and for these simulations to become routine, close collaborations with computer scientists are essential to ensure that numerical codes can take full advantage of the latest computing architecture.},

abstract = {In response to the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, surge risk assessment approaches have been re-evaluated to develop more rapid, reliable methods for predicting the risk associated with extreme hurricanes. Here, the development of dimensionless surge response functions relating surge to hurricane meteorological parameters is presented. Such response functions present an opportunity to maximize surge data usage and to improve statistical estimates of surge probability by providing a means for defining continuous probability density functions. A numerical modeling investigation was carried out for the Texas, USA coastline to develop physical scaling laws relating storm surge response with hurricane parameters including storm size, intensity, and track. It will be shown that these scaling laws successfully estimate the surge response at any arbitrary location for any arbitrary storm track within the study region. Such a prediction methodology has the potential to decrease numerical computation requirements by 75{\%} for hurricane risk assessment studies.},

abstract = {The coupling of models is a commonly used approach when addressing the complex interactions between different components of earth systems. We demonstrate that this approach can result in a reduction of errors in wave forecasting, especially in dynamically complicated coastal ocean areas, such as the southern part of the North Sea {\&}ndash; the German Bight. Here, we study the effects of coupling of an atmospheric model (COSMO) and a wind wave model (WAM), which is enabled by implementing wave-induced drag in the atmospheric model. The numerical simulations use a regional North Sea coupled wave{\&}ndash;atmosphere model as well as a nested-grid high-resolution German Bight wave model. Using one atmospheric and two wind wave models simultaneously allows for study of the individual and combined effects of two-way coupling and grid resolution. This approach proved to be particularly important under severe storm conditions as the German Bight is a very shallow and dynamically complex coastal area exposed to storm floods. The two-way coupling leads to a reduction of both surface wind speeds and simulated wave heights. In this study, the sensitivity of atmospheric parameters, such as wind speed and atmospheric pressure, to the wave-induced drag, in particular under storm conditions, and the impact of two-way coupling on the wave model performance, is quantified. Comparisons between data from in situ and satellite altimeter observations indicate that two-way coupling improves the simulation of wind and wave parameters of the model and justify its implementation for both operational and climate simulations.},

Solitary waves of which relative wave heights, H/h0, ranged from 0.03 to 0.31 were generated by two types of wave-board displacement trajectory: the ramp-trajectory and the solitary-wave trajectory proposed by Goring (1979). Experimental results show that under the same relative wave height, the waveforms produced by the two generation procedures becomes noticeably different as the waves propagate prior to the breaking point. Meanwhile, under the same relative wave height, the larger the constant water depth is, the larger the dimensionless run-up heights would be. Scale effects associated with the breaking process are discussed.},

abstract = {The Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological (WRF-Hydro) system is a state-of-the-art numerical model that models the entire hydrological cycle based on physical principles. As with other hydrological models, WRF-Hydro parameterizes many physical processes. Hence, WRF-Hydro needs to be calibrated to optimize its output with respect to observations for the application region. When applied to a relatively large domain, both WRF-Hydro simulations and calibrations require intensive computing resources and are best performed on multimode, multicore high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Typically, each physics-based model requires a calibration process that works specifically with that model and is not transferrable to a different process or model. The parameter estimation tool (PEST) is a flexible and generic calibration tool that can be used in principle to calibrate any of these models. In its existing configuration, however, PEST is not designed to work on the current generation of massively parallel HPC clusters. To address this issue, we ported the parallel PEST to HPCs and adapted it to work with WRF-Hydro. The porting involved writing scripts to modify the workflow for different workload managers and job schedulers, as well as to connect the parallel PEST to WRF-Hydro. To test the operational feasibility and the computational benefits of this first-of-itskind HPC-enabled parallel PEST, we developed a case study using a flood in the midwestern United States in 2013. Results on a problem involving the calibration of 22 parameters show that on the same computing resources used for parallel WRF-Hydro, the HPC-enabled parallel PEST can speed up the calibration process by a factor of up to 15 compared with commonly used PEST in sequential mode. The speedup factor is expected to be greater with a larger calibration problem (e.g., more parameters to be calibrated or a larger size of study area).},

The new approach is evaluated by large-eddy simulations of a utility-scale National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)-5MW wind turbine. The results show that the Lagrangian approach of velocity sampling is effective to reduce the spurious numerical oscillations in the modeling results. The good match with the benchmark data indicates that correct free upwind velocity can be obtained with a careful determination of the associated time scale. Also, a piecewise function is proposed to replace the Gaussian function for the force projection process.},

abstract = {A new approach to modelling free surface flows is developed that enables, for the first time, 3D consistent non-hydrostatic baroclinic physics that wets and drys in the large aspect ratio spatial domains that characterise geophysical systems. This is key in the integration of physical models to permit seamless simulation in a single consistent arbitrarily unstructured multiscale and multi-physics dynamical model. A high order continuum representation is achieved through a general Galerkin finite element formulation that guarantees local and global mass conservation, and consistent tracer advection. A flexible spatial discretisation permits conforming domain bounds and a variable spatial resolution, whilst atypical use of fully implicit time integration ensures computational efficiency. Notably this brings the natural inclusion of non-hydrostatic baroclinic physics and a consideration of vertical inertia to flood modelling in the full 3D domain. This has application in improving modelling of inundation processes in geophysical domains, where dynamics proceeds over a large range of horizontal extents relative to vertical resolution, such as in the evolution of a tsunami, or in urban environments containing complex geometric structures at a range of scales.},

abstract = {Periods of high astronomically generated tides contribute to the occurrence of extreme sea levels. Over interannual time scales, two precessions associated with the orbit of the Moon cause systematic variation of high tides. A global assessment of when these tidal modulations occur allows for the prediction of periods when the enhanced risk of coastal flooding is likely in different parts of the world. This paper uses modeled tides to assess the influence of the 18.61 year lunar nodal cycle and the 8.85 year cycle of lunar perigee (which affects high tidal levels as a quasi 4.4 year cycle) on high tidal levels on a global scale. Tidal constituents from the TPXO7.2 global tidal model are used, with satellite modulation corrections based on equilibrium tide expectations, to predict multidecadal hourly time series of tides on a one-quarter degree global grid. These time series are used to determine the amplitude and phase of tidal modulations using harmonic analysis fitted to 18.61, 9.305, 8.85, and 4.425 year sinusoidal signals. The spatial variations in the range and phase of the tidal modulations are related to the global distribution of the main tidal constituents and tidal characteristics (diurnal or semidiurnal and tidal range). Results indicate that the 18.61 year nodal cycle has the greatest influence in diurnal regions with tidal ranges of {\textgreater}4 m and that the 4.4 year cycle is largest in semidiurnal regions where the tidal range is {\textgreater}6 m. The phase of the interannual tidal modulations is shown to relate to the form of the tide.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional numerical model was presented for the simulation of wave breaking, runup and turbulence in the surf and swash zones. The main components of the model are the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations describing the average motion of a turbulent flow, a k–$\epsilon$ turbulence closure model describing the transformation and dissipation processes of turbulence and a volume of fluid technique for tracking the free surface motion. Nearshore wave evolution on a sloping bed, the velocity field and other wave characteristics were investigated. First, the results of the model were compared with experimental results for different surf zone hydrodynamic conditions. Spilling and plunging breakers were simulated and the numerical model investigated for different wave parameters. The turbulence field was also considered and the spatial and time-dependent variations of turbulence parameters were discussed. In the next stage of the study, numerical results were compared with two sets of experimental data in the swash zone. Generally, there is good agreement except for turbulence predictions near the breaking point where the model does not represent well the physical processes. On the other hand, turbulence predictions were found to be excellent for the swash zone. The model provides a precise and efficient tool for the simulation of the flow field and wave transformations in the nearshore, especially in the swash zone. The numerical model can simulate the surface elevation of the vertical shoreline excursion on sloping beaches, while swash–swash interactions within the swash zone are accounted for.},

abstract = {The properties of hurricanes directly influence storm surges; however, the implications of projected changes to the climate are unclear. Here, we simulate the storm surges of historical storms under present day and end of century climate scenarios to assess the impact of climate change on storm surge inundation. We simulate 21 storms that impacted the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Coasts of the continental U.S. from 2000 to 2013. We find that the volume of inundation increases for 14 storms and the average change for all storms is +36{\%}. The extent of inundation increases for 13 storms, and the average change for all storms is +25{\%}. Notable increases in inundation occur near Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, the west coast of Florida, the Carolinas, and New Jersey. Our calculations of inundation volume and extent suggest that at the end of the century, we can expect hurricanes to produce larger storm surge magnitudes in concentrated areas, as opposed to surges with lower magnitudes that are widespread. We examine changes in maximum wind speed, minimum central pressure, translation speed, and radius of the 33 ms−1 wind to assess the impacts of individual storm characteristics on storm surge. We find that there is no single storm characteristic that directly relates to storm surge inundation or its climate induced changes. Even when all the characteristics are considered together, the resulting influences are difficult to anticipate. This is likely due to the complexity of the hydrodynamics and interactions with local geography. This illustrates that even as climate change research advances and more is known about projected impacts to hurricanes, implications for storm surge will be difficult to predict without explicit numerical simulation.},

abstract = {The tides in the South China Sea were simulated using an established tidal model, with the purpose to evaluate if non-assimilated modeling of the area is feasible. Simulations were done for the locally dominating diurnal (K1) and semi-diurnal (M2) tidal constituents, and the model was shown to provide reasonably accurate results in terms of both elevations and levels of dissipation. However, this was only the case when a realistic tidal conversion parameterization was included in the model, and it is suggested that tidal conversion is a missing process in other model efforts of the area. Compared to observations, the modeled dissipation levels were slightly overestimated when integrated over the entire domain, and far larger in the model at topography with a slope which is supercritical for the baroclinic tidal waves. A crude, empirical correction of the tidal conversion rates at supercritical topography is suggested and implemented in the model and shown to improve the model results in terms of both elevations and dissipation rates. It is concluded that the presented model set up is suitable for investigations of how perturbations, e.g., future sea-level rise, will affect the tidal dynamics in the South China Sea.},

abstract = {This paper and its companion Higuera et al. (2014--this issue) introduce the formulation of Volume-Averaged Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (VARANS) equations in OpenFOAM{\textregistered} to simulate two-phase flow through porous media. This new implementation, so-called IHFOAM, corrects the limitations of the original OpenFOAM{\textregistered} code. An innovative hybrid methodology (2D-3D) is presented to optimize the simulation time needed to assess the three-dimensional effects of wave interaction with coastal structures. The combined use of a 2D and a 3D model enables the practical application of the 3D VARANS code to simulate real cases, contributing to a significant speed-up. This is highly convenient and especially suitable for non-conventional structures, as it overcomes the limitations inherent to applying semi-empirical formulations out of their range or 2D simulations only. A detailed study of stability and overtopping for a 3D porous high-mound breakwater at prototype scale subjected to oblique irregular (random) waves is carried out. Pressure around the caissons, overtopping discharge rate and turbulent magnitudes are presented in three dimensions. The mean pressure laws present a high degree of accordance with the formulation provided by Goda-Takahashi. Furthermore, local effects due to three-dimensional processes play a significant role, especially close to the breakwater head. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The study provides an understanding of the various length scales and dynamics of the eddies affected by the LES model and also the fundamental physics behind the inner and outer layer eddies which are responsible for the correct behavior of the mean statistics in accordance with the definition of equilibrium layers by Townsend.

abstract = {A high-resolution unstructured-grid global-regional nested ice-current coupled FVCOM system was configured for the Arctic Ocean and used to examine the impact of model resolution and geometrical fitting on the basin-coastal scale circulation and transport in the pan-Arctic. With resolving steep bottom slope and irregular coastal geometry, the model was capable of simulating the multi-scale circulation and its spatial variability in the Arctic Basin and flow through the Bering Strait, Fram Strait and Canadian Archipelago. The model-simulated annual-mean velocities were in good agreement with observations within the measurement uncertainty and variability due to insufficient sampling. The errors in the flow direction varied with the flow speed, larger in the weak velocity zone and smaller as the velocity increased. In the upper 50-m layer, the annual-mean circulation pattern was dominated by the wind- and ice-drifting-induced anticyclonic circulation in the Arctic Basin and a relatively strong cyclonic slope current along the edge of the continental shelf. In the deep 200-600-m layer, a relatively permanent cyclonic circulation occurred along the steep bottom slope. These annual-mean circulations accounted for {\~{}}85{\%} of the total kinetic energy variance. De-trending the mean flow, an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis showed that the semi-annual and seasonal variability of the sub-tidal flow was dominated by the first and second modes that accounted for {\~{}}46{\%} and {\~{}}30{\%} of the total variance in the upper 50-m layer and {\~{}}58{\%} and 20{\%} in the deep 200-600-m layer. Consistent with observations, the AO-FVCOM-simulated cyclonic slope flow was characterized by a large positive topostrophy. Sensitivity experiment results with various grid configurations suggested that the currents over slopes, narrow straits and water passages featured topographic and baroclinic frontal dynamical scales associated with bathymetric slope and internal Rossby deformation radius. Over the Arctic slope, since these two scales are in the same order, the along-slope current could be captured, as the cross-isobath model resolution was refined to resolve the steep bottom topography. Under this condition, there is no need to add Neptune forcing into the momentum equations. The accuracy of the estimation of the transport through the strait and narrow water passage was affected by the model resolution. In Fram Strait where the flow is characterized by strong lateral current shear resulting from the Atlantic inflow and Arctic outflow, the transport estimation could have a significant uncertainty due to both horizontal and vertical sampling resolutions.},

abstract = {The response of the sea level to atmospheric forcing is investigated through the cross-spectral analysis of tide-gauge data from around 100 island and deep-ocean stations and atmospheric pressure records. The focus is at a period of 5 days, coinciding with an atmospheric pressure oscillation (Madden-Julian wave) of the same frequency. Outside the Tropics the energy in synoptic weather systems masks the small amplitude of the pressure wave, resulting in a response indistinguishable from that of an inverse barometer (IB). Within the Tropics, variability of air pressure is smaller in comparison with the amplitude of the pressure wave and departures from the 113 model are found. Analysis of several sub-surface pressure records in the tropical Atlantic also yields departures at this time-scale, and indicates the barotropic nature of the response. Findings from a near-global barotropic numerical model forced with realistic air pressure and wind-stress fields show reasonable agreement with results at tide-gauge locations, and provide a more complete view of the sea-level response. These results indicate the possibility of providing an improved simulation of sea-level response to atmospheric-pressure forcing at this time-scale than is currently provided by the 113 model, for example in the field of satellite altimetry.},

abstract = {A coupled atmosphere-wave-oceanmodeling system (CAWOMS) based on the integration of atmosphere- wave, atmosphere-ocean, and wave-current interaction processes is developed. The componentmodels consist of theWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF)model, the SimulatingWavesNearshore (SWAN)model, and the Princeton OceanModel (POM). The coupling between themodel components is implemented by using the Model Coupling Toolkit. The CAWOMS takes into account various wave-related effects, including wave state and sea-spray-affected sea surface roughness, sea spray heat fluxes, and dissipative heating in atmosphere-wave coupling. It also considers oceanic effects such as the feedback of sea surface temperature (SST) cooling and the impact of sea surface current on wind stress in atmosphere-ocean coupling. In addition, wave-current interactions, including radiation stress and wave-induced bottom stress, are also taken into account. The CAWOMS is applied to the simulation of an idealized tropical cyclone (TC) to investigate the effects of atmosphere-wave-ocean coupling on TC intensity. Results show that atmosphere-wave coupling strengthens the TC system, while the thermodynamic coupling between the atmosphere and ocean weakens the TC as a result of the negative feedback of TC-induced SST cooling. The overall effects of atmosphere-wave-ocean coupling on TC intensity are determined by the balance between wave-related positive feedback and the negative feedback attributable to TC-induced SST cooling. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

@article{Kolar1994,
abstract = {One class of surface water models is the shallow water models obtained by depth-averaging the microscale mass and momentum balances. Application of shallow water models to large scale problems (on the order of 1000's of km) requires the use of spherical coordinates. Traditionally, balance laws in spherical coordinates are derived by simply expanding the spatial operators in the standard depth-averaged equations. However, the equations themselves are based on an assumed planar surface so that an inconsistency exists between the derivation and the interpretation. In this article, a method is presented that properly accounts for the curvature of the Earth during the depth-averaging procedure. The derivation gives rise to new terms in both the continuity and momentum balances, terms that we refer to as curvature terms. A scaling analysis evaluates the magnitude of the terms. It is shown that the curvature term in the continuity balance is insignificant when the vertical velocity is small, i.e., at least four orders of magnitude less than lateral components. Similarly, when the vertical velocity is small, the curvature term in the momentum balance that comes from the convective terms is insignificant. The second curvature term in the momentum balance is associated with the macroscopic stress tensor; it is on the same order of magnitude as other stress terms and should be retained when momentum dissipation is modeled. Finite element discretization of the resulting balance laws utilizes the generalized wave continuity equation which, because of its monotonie dispersion relation, eliminates noise in the solution without resorting to artificial damping. A cartographic mapping simplifies finite element implementation in spherical coordinates so that Cartesian master elements can be used. Finally, an application to the Western North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico illustrates the importance of using equations in spherical coordinates for large scale applications. {\textcopyright} 1994 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

In this method, the field of BFCs is constructed by interpolating values at independent points using a surface spline. The surface spline interpolation has an advantage: that the constructed surface is smoother than the surface constructed by the traditionally used linear interpolation, which has unrealistic extrema. The method is validated in twin experiments where the prescribed nonlinear distribution of BFCs are better inverted with the surface spline interpolation. In practical experiments, the BFCs are inverted and the M2 tide in the Bohai Sea is simulated by assimilating the TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) data. The small errors between the simulation results and the observations, as well as the accurate cotidal charts, demonstrate the feasibility of the new method in practical application.},

abstract = {A new global ocean model (MPAS-Ocean) capable of using enhanced resolution in selected regions of the ocean domain is described and evaluated. Three simulations using different grids are presented. The first grid is a uniform high-resolution (15. km) mesh; the second grid has similarly high resolution (15. km) in the North Atlantic (NA), but coarse resolution elsewhere; the third grid is a variable resolution grid like the second but with higher resolution (7.5. km) in the NA. Simulation results are compared to observed sea-surface height (SSH), SSH variance and selected current transports. In general, the simulations produce subtropical and subpolar gyres with peak SSH amplitudes too strong by between 0.25 and 0.40. m. The mesoscale eddy activity within the NA is, in general, well simulated in both structure and amplitude. The uniform high-resolution simulation produces reasonable representations of mesoscale activity throughout the global ocean. Simulations using the second variable-resolution grid are essentially identical to the uniform case within the NA region. The third case with higher NA resolution produces a simulation that agrees somewhat better in the NA with observed SSH, SSH variance and transports than the two 15. km simulations. The actual throughput, including I/O, for the x1-15km simulation is the same as the structured grid Parallel Ocean Program ocean model in its standard high-resolution 0.1° configuration. Our overall conclusion is that this ocean model is a viable candidate for multi-resolution simulations of the global ocean system on climate-change time scales. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Debris movement was measured using two overhead video cameras and a novel object-tracking algorithm. Two standard optical techniques, wave edge detection and particle image velocimetry, were used to compare optical and in situ measurements of fluid velocity. The debris motion (position, velocity) in the onshore direction was found to be repeatable, but the offshore motion varied between trials because of the irregular nature of the flow field during the return. For debris in free translation, as the number of debris specimens increased, the peak average velocity decreased and the onset of the peak was delayed in the onshore direction.

abstract = {This study involved developing and testing a data assimilation framework that accommodates different types of geophysical ocean data (i.e., surface velocity and wave information) and provides an estimation of the bathymetry of a mixed-energy tidal inlet. This framework was successfully applied to a highly variable tidal environment using synthetic data (twin test). The synthetic data consisted of surface velocity components associated with the tidal circulation and wavenumber-frequency pairs of incoming surface gravity waves that mimic data that could be derived from an airborne synthetic aperture radar system and a tower-mounted Xband radar system, respectively. The present ensemble-based assimilation framework has previously been applied in both wave-dominated coastal and current-dominated riverine environments. In contrast, the inlet environment is neither wave nor current dominated. The assimilation of wave and current data together was most useful to obtain a skillful estimate of the spatial map of bathymetry.},

abstract = {Compound flooding in coastal regions, that is, the simultaneous or successive occurrence of high sea levels and high river flows, is expected to increase in a warmer world. To date, however, there is no robust evidence on projected changes in compound flooding for northwestern Europe. We combine projected storm surges and river floods with probabilistic, localized relative sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios to assess the future compound flood hazard over northwestern coastal Europe in the high (RCP8.5) emission scenario. We use high-resolution, dynamically downscaled regional climate models (RCM) to drive a storm surge model and a hydrological model, and analyze the joint occurrence of high coastal water levels and associated river peaks in a multivariate copula-based approach. The RCM-forced multimodel mean reasonably represents the observed spatial pattern of the dependence strength between annual maxima surge and peak river discharge, although substantial discrepancies exist between observed and simulated dependence strength. All models overestimate the dependence strength, possibly due to limitations in model parameterizations. This bias affects compound flood hazard estimates and requires further investigation. While our results suggest decreasing compound flood hazard over the majority of sites by 2050s (2040–2069) compared to the reference period (1985–2005), an increase in projected compound flood hazard is limited to around 34{\%} of the sites. Further, we show the substantial role of SLR, a driver of compound floods, which has frequently been neglected. Our findings highlight the need to be aware of the limitations of the current generation of Earth system models in simulating coastal compound floods.},

abstract = {[1] A systematic investigation of storm surge along the coast of Louisiana was conducted by using the fully nonlinear Finite-Volume Coastal Ocean Model. FVCOM was first applied to Hurricane Rita and validated by in situ measurements. Experiments were conducted with different parameters to evaluate the impacts of each factor on inundation over a wide and shallow shelf. Results show that a hurricane's forward speed is a significant parameter which has been overlooked in previous studies. Resonance may occur for certain hurricane forward motion speeds: increasing this speed increases peak surge heights while decreasing inland volume of flood. The effects of wind intensity, Radius of Maximum Winds, tidal timing, amplitude, and wind inflow angle were also examined. It was concluded that varying a storm's forward motion may account for variations in flooded volumes equivalent to an upgrade or downgrade of about 1 category on the Saffir-Simpson scale.

abstract = {The problem of computing within a limited domain surrounded by open boundaries is discussed within the context of the shallow-water wave equations by comparing three different treatments, all of which surround the domain by absorbing zones intended to prevent reflections of outgoing waves. The first, which has attracted a lot of attention for use in electromagnetic and aeroacoustic applications, is intended to prevent all reflections. However, it has not yet been developed to handle the second important requirement of open boundaries, namely the ability to pass information about external conditions into the domain of interest. The other two treatments, which absorb differences from a specified external solution, allow information to pass through the open boundary in both directions. One, based on the flow relaxation scheme of [Martinsen, E.A., Engedahl, H., 1987. Implementation and testing of a lateral boundary scheme as an open-boundary condition in a barotropic ocean model. Coastal Eng. 11, 603-627] and termed here the "simple sponge," relaxes all fields toward their external counterparts. The other, a simplification and generalization of the perfectly matched layer, referred to here as the "pretty good sponge," avoids absorbing the component of momentum parallel to the open boundary. Comparisons for a case that is dominated by outgoing waves shows the pretty good sponge to perform essentially as well as the perfectly matched layer and better than the simple sponge. In comparisons for a geostrophically balanced eddy passing through open boundaries, the pretty good sponge out-performed the simple sponge when the only external information available was about the advecting flow, but when information about the nature of the eddy in the sponge zones was also available, the simple sponge performed better. For the case of an equatorial soliton passing through the boundary and no information provided about its nature outside the open domain, again the pretty good sponge performed better. Proving useful for situations governed by nonlinear equations forced by external conditions and being easy to implement, the pretty good sponge should be considered for use with existing limited-area ocean models.},

In this study, a highly elaborated computational model based on a dynamic fluid body interaction method with a superimposed motion and catenary mooring solver is applied and compared with common engineering approaches. An overset-based technique is also utilized to effectively handle large movements of a full floating wind turbine body due to the coupled influence of wind-wave loads. The DeepCwind semi-submersible floating platform mounted by the NREL 5-MW baseline wind turbine is used to obtain validation and verification of the new computational model with the experimental test data and the NREL FAST code. Various computational results for unsteady aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and fully coupled aero-hydrodynamics including mooring line loads are compared stage by stage with the test data and numerical results calculated by the NREL FAST code. Overall, the predicted results of the aerodynamic performances, platform dynamic responses, and mooring line tensions show good agreements with the presented numerical solutions and the FAST solutions. In addition, multi-phase unsteady flow fields with complex inference effects in the blade-tip vortices, shedding vortices, and turbulent wakes are numerically visualized and investigated in detail.},

abstract = {Surge hazards induced by tropical cyclones have caused substantial economic losses and casualties for coastal communities worldwide. Under projected sea level rise (SLR), it is not well understood how the probabilistic surge hazard may change. Coastal planning and engineering usually adopt the “bathtub” method to evaluate the surge-SLR response, where surge with SLR is considered to be the exact summation of the two. This method has been shown by previous studies to be unreliable. Studies on surge-SLR response either use a low-fidelity model setup or rely on individual storm's surge to represent the probabilistic surge due to the high computational burden. Herein, we use high-fidelity numerical models in the Tampa region, West Florida, consider 188 synthetic storms and four SLR scenarios, and investigate the surge-SLR response and its physical drivers. Compared to the direct summation of present-day surge and SLR amount, results show that the probabilistic surge with SLR can be 1.0 m larger, while different individual storm's surge with the same magnitude can be 1.5 m larger or 0.1 m smaller, indicating the importance of not relying on a limited number of surge events to assess the probabilistic surge response to SLR. Investigation of the physical drivers shows that distinct topographic features of the study area and storm forward speed notably affect the surge-SLR response. When considering 1.3 m or larger SLR in the study area, complex topography, and large surge events, the effects of SLR on the probabilistic surge are hard to predict and should be investigated more carefully.},

In this paper, we propose a framework for quantifying risks, including (1) the effects of forecast errors, (2) the ability to resolve critical grid features that are important to accurate site-specific forecasts, and (3) a framework that can move us toward performance-based/cost-based decisions, within an extremely fast execution time. A key element presently lacking in previous studies is the interrelationship between the effects of combined random errors and bias in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and bias and random errors in surge models. This approach examines the number of degrees of freedom in present forecasts and develops an equation for the quantification of these types of errors within a unified system, given the number of degrees of freedom in the NWP forecasts. It is shown that the methodology can be used to provide information on the forecasts and along with the combined uncertainty due to all of the individual contributions. A potential important benefit from studies using this approach would be the ability to estimate financial and other trade-offs between higher-cost “rapid” evacuation methods and lower-cost “slower” evacuation methods. Analyses here show that uncertainty inherent in these decisions depends strongly on forecast time and geographic location. Methods based on sets of surge maxima do not capture this uncertainty and would be difficult to use for this purpose. In particular, it is shown that surge model bias can play a dominant role in distorting the forecast probabilities.},

abstract = {A climatological description ("climatology") of storm surges and actual flooding (storm tide) events from 1959 to 2007 is presented for the New York City (NYC) harbor. The prevailing meteorological conditions associated with these surges are also highlighted. Two surge thresholds of 0.6-1.0 m and {\textgreater}1.0 m were used at the Battery, New York (south side of Manhattan in NYC), to identify minor and moderate events, respectively. The minor-surge threshold combined with a tide at or above mean high water (MHW) favors a coastal flood advisory for NYC, and the moderate surge aboveMHW leads to a coastal flood warning. The number of minor surges has decreased gradually during the last several decades at NYC while the number of minor (storm tide) flooding events has increased slightly given the gradual rise in sea level. There were no moderate flooding events at the Battery from 1997 to 2007, which is the quietest period during the last 50 yr. However, if sea level rises 12-50 cm during the next century, the number of moderate flooding events is likely to increase exponentially. Using cyclone tracking and compositing of the NCEP global reanalysis (before 1979) and regional reanalysis (after 1978) data, the mean synoptic evolution was obtained for the NYC surge events. There are a variety of storm tracks associated with minor surges, whereas moderate surges favor a cyclone tracking northward along the East Coast. The average surface winds at NYC veer from northwesterly at 48 h before the time of maximum surge to a persistent period of east-northeasterlies beginning about 24 h before the surge. There is a relatively large variance in wind directions and speeds around the time of maximum surge, thus suggesting the importance of other factors (fetch, storm duration and track, etc.).},

OSTIA uses satellite SST data provided by international agencies via the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) Regional/Global Task Sharing (R/GTS) framework. GHRSST products include data from microwave and infrared satellite instruments with accompanying uncertainty estimates. The system also uses in situ SST data available over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) and a sea-ice concentration product from the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Applications Facility (OSI-SAF). The SST analysis is a multi-scale optimal interpolation that is designed for applications in numerical weather prediction and ocean forecasting systems. The background error covariance matrix is specified using ocean model data and the analysis uses correlation length scales of 10. km and 100. km. The OSTIA system produces a foundation SST estimate (SSTfnd, which is the SST free of diurnal variability) at an output grid resolution of 1/20° ({\~{}}. 6. km) although the smallest analysis feature resolution is based on the correlation length scale of 10. km. All satellite SST data are adjusted for bias errors based on a combination of ENVISAT Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) SST data and in situ SST measurements from drifting buoys. Data are filtered (based on surface wind speed data) to remove diurnal variability and AATSR data are adjusted to represent the SST at the same depth as drifting buoy measurements (0.2-1. m) before bias adjustments are made. Global coverage outputs are provided each day in GHRSST L4 netCDF format. A variety of secondary products are also provided including weekly and monthly mean data sets. OSTIA products are continuously monitored and validation/verification activities demonstrate that SST products have zero mean bias and an accuracy of {\~{}}. 0.57. K compared to in situ measurements. OSTIA is now used operationally as a boundary condition for all weather forecast models at the Met Office and at European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). OSTIA is produced by the Met Office as part of the European Union Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) MyOcean project. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {To create more useful storm surge and inundation forecast products, probabilistic elements are being incorporated. To achieve the highest levels of confidence in these products, it is essential that as many simulations as possible are performed during the limited amount of time available. This paper develops a framework by which probabilistic storm surge and inundation forecasts within the Curvilinear Hydrodynamics in 3D (CH3D) Storm Surge Modeling System and the Southeastern Universities Research Association Coastal Ocean Observing and Prediction Program's forecasting systems are initiated with specific focus on the application of these methods in a limited-resource environment. Ensemble sets are created by dividing probability density functions (PDFs) of the National Hurricane Center model forecast error into bins, which are then grouped into priority levels (PLs) such that each subsequent level relies on results computed earlier and has an increasing confidence associated with it. The PDFs are then used to develop an ensemble of analytic wind and pressure fields for use by storm surge and inundation models. Using this approach applied with official National Hurricane Center (OFCL) forecast errors, an analysis of Hurricane Charley is performed. After first validating the simulation of storm surge, a series of ensemble simulations are performed representing the forecast errors for the 72-, 48-, 24-, and 12-h forecasts. Analysis of the aggregated products shows that PL4 (27 members) is sufficient to resolve 90{\%} of the inundation within the domain and appears to represent the best balance between accuracy and timeliness of computed products for this case study.A5-day forecast using the PL4 set is shown to complete in 83 min, while the intermediate PL2 and PL3 products, representing slightly less confidence, complete in 14 and 28 min, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

The cyclones were identified using an automated tracking algorithm applied to sea level pressure every 6 h. The CMIP5 results for the historical period were evaluated using the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR). The CMIP5 models were ranked given their track density, intensity, and overall performance for the historical period. It was found that six of the top seven CMIP5 models with the highest spatial resolution were ranked the best overall. These models had less underprediction of cyclone track density, more realistic distribution of intense cyclones along the U.S. East Coast, and more realistic cyclogenesis and deepening rates. The best seven models were used to determine projected future changes in cyclones, which included a 10{\%}-30{\%} decrease in cyclone track density and weakening of cyclones over the western Atlantic storm track, while in contrast there is a 10{\%}-20{\%} increase in cyclone track density over the eastern United States, including 10{\%}-40{\%} more intense ({\textless}980 hPa) cyclones and 20{\%}-40{\%} more rapid deepening rates just inland of the U.S. East Coast. Some of the reasons for these CMIP5 model differences were explored for the selected models based on model generated Eady growth rate, upper-level jet, surface baroclinicity, and precipitation. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

We present algorithms for automatic generation of a size function, discretized on a background grid, by using distance functions and numerical PDE solvers. The size function is adapted to the geometry, taking into account the local feature size and the boundary curvature. It also obeys a grading constraint that limits the size ratio of neighboring elements. We formulate the feature size in terms of the medial axis transform, and show how to compute it accurately from a distance function. We propose a new Gradient Limiting Equation for the mesh grading requirement, and we show how to solve it numerically with Hamilton–Jacobi solvers. We show examples of the techniques using Cartesian and unstructured background grids in 2D and 3D, and applications with numerical adaptation and mesh generation for images.},

abstract = {The unstructured-grid, Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) was used to simulate the tides in the Gulf of Maine (GoM) and New England Shelf (NES) for homogeneous and summer stratified conditions. FVCOM captures the near-resonant nature of the semidiurnal tide and energy flux in the GoM and the complex dynamics governing the tide in the NES. Stratification has limited impact on tidal elevation, but can significantly modify the tidal current profile. Internal tides are energetic in the stratified regions over steep bottom topography, but their contribution to the total tidal energy flux is only significant over the northeast flank of Georges Bank. The model suggests that the tidal flushing-induced eddy east of Monomoy Island is the dynamic basis for the locally observed phase lead of the M2 tide. The southward propagating tidal wave east of Cape Cod encounters the northeastward propagating tidal wave from the NES south of Nantucket Island, forming a zone of minimum sea level along a southeast-oriented line from Nantucket Island. These two waves are characterized by linear dynamics in which bottom friction and advection are negligible in the momentum balance, but their superposition leads to a strong nonlinear current interaction and large bottom stress in the zone of lowest sea elevation.},

abstract = {This letter examines the magnitude, spatial footprint, and paths of hurricanes and extratropical cyclones (ETCs) that caused strong surge along the east coast of the US between 1979 and 2013. Lagrangian cyclone track information, for hurricanes and ETCs, is used to associate surge events with individual storms. First, hurricane influence is examined using ranked surged events per site. The fraction of hurricanes among storms associated with surge decreases from 20{\%}-60{\%} for the top 10 events to 10{\%}-30{\%} for the top 50 events, and a clear latitudinal gradient of hurricane influence emerges for larger sets of events. Secondly, surges on larger spatial domains are examined by focusing on storms that cause exceedance of the probabilistic 1-year surge return level at multiple stations. Results show that if the strongest events in terms of surge amplitude and spatial extent are considered, then hurricanes are most likely to create the hazards. However, when slightly less strong events that still impact multiple areas during the storm life cycle are considered, the relative importance of hurricanes shrinks as that of ETCs grows. Furthermore we find distinct paths for ETCs causing multi-site surge at individual segments of the US east coast.},

abstract = {High-resolution large-eddy simulation is used to investigate the mean and turbulence properties of a separated flow in a channel constricted by periodically distributed hill-shaped protrusions on one wall that obstruct the channel by 33{\%} of its height and are arranged 9 hill heights apart. The geometry is a modification of an experimental configuration, the adaptation providing an extended region of post-reattachment recovery and allowing high-quality simulations to be performed at acceptable computing costs. The Reynolds number, based on the hill height and the bulk velocity above the crest is 10 595. The simulated domain is streamwise as well as spanwise periodic, extending from one hill crest to the next in the streamwise direction and over 4.5 hill heights in the spanwise direction. This arrangement minimizes uncertainties associated with boundary conditions and makes the flow an especially attractive generic test case for validating turbulence closures for statistically two-dimensional separation. The emphasis of the study is on elucidating the turbulence mechanisms associated with separation, recirculation reattachment, acceleration and wall proximity. Hence, careful attention has been paid to resolution, and a body-fitted, low-aspect-ratio, nearly orthogonal numerical grid of close to 5 million nodes has been used. Unusually, the results of two entirely independent simulations with different codes for identical flow and numerical conditions are compared and shown to agree closely. Results are included for mean velocity, Reynolds stresses, anisotropy measures, spectra and budgets for the Reynolds stresses. Moreover, an analysis of structural characteristics is undertaken on the basis of instantaneous realizations, and links to features observed in the statistical results are identified and interpreted. Among a number of interesting features, a distinct 'splatting' of eddies on the windward hill side following reattachment is observed, which generates strong spanwise fluctuations that are reflected, statistically, by the spanwise normal stress near the wall exceeding that of the streamwise stress by a substantial margin, despite the absence of spanwise strain. {\textcopyright} 2005 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {The present paper and its companion (Higuera et al., 2012) introduce OpenFOAM{\textregistered} as a tool to consider for coastal engineering applications as it solves 3D domains and considers two-phase flow. In this first paper, OpenFOAM{\textregistered} utilities are presented and the free surface flow solvers are analysed. The lack of specific boundary conditions for realistic wave generation is overcome with their implementation combined with active wave absorption. Wave generation includes all the widely used theories plus specific piston-type wavemaker replication. Also standalone active wave absorption implementation is explained for several formulations, all of which are applicable to 3D cases. Active wave absorption is found to enhance stability by decreasing the energy of the system and to correct the increasing water level on long simulations. Furthermore, it is advantageous with respect to dissipation zones such as sponge layers, as it does not increase the computational domain. The results vary depending on the theory (2D, Quasi-3D and 3D) but overall performance of the implemented methods is very good. The simulations and results of the present paper are purely theoretical. Comparisons with laboratory data are presented in the second paper (Higuera et al., 2012).},

abstract = {The importance of wind energy as an alternative energy source has increased over the latest years with more focus on offshore winds. A good estimation of the offshore winds is thus of major importance for this industry. Up to now the effect of the wind–wave (mis)alignment has not yet been taken into account in coupled atmosphere–wave models to study the vertical wind profile and power production estimations of offshore wind farms. In this study the roughness length parametrization of Drennan et al. in 2003, and its extension addressing the wind–wave (mis)alignment proposed by Porchetta et al. in 2019, are investigated in the Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere–Wave–Sediment Transport (COAWST) model. This study shows that the yearly mean wind estimation at hub height (100 m) is improved by the roughness length parametrization of Porchetta et al. compared to Drennan. This is mainly due to the increased roughness of the former parametrization compare to the latter, even in aligned wind–wave conditions. This difference in roughness is caused by the dataset used to obtain the constants, deep-water conditions versus mixed offshore conditions. Moreover, the roughness length parametrization of Porchetta et al. performs better in two of three alignment categories. Furthermore, similar model performances are obtained if we exclude the wind directions from the wind shadow zone of the measurement mast or the wind directions from the recently built Alpha Ventus wind farm, which is in close vicinity of the measurement mast. Investigating different wind conditions shows that the new roughness length parametrization of Porchetta et al. performs best for both offshore and onshore winds. Additionally, we show that the coupled model estimations of the vertical wind are only slightly affected by significant wave height estimations. Similar model performances for different accuracies of significant wave height estimations are presented. One exception is the perpendicular alignment category where the new roughness length of Porchetta et al. outperforms the roughness length of Drennan when investigating the wind estimations related to significant wave heights with a higher accuracy. The roughness length parametrization of Porchetta et al. reduced the power production overestimation of the coupled model from 5.7 to 2.8{\%}. We also show that the standalone atmospheric model including the roughness length of Charnock in 1955 has a degraded performance compared to the coupled model including the roughness length parametrization of Porchetta et al. for yearly average wind profiles.},

abstract = { Storm surge and coastal flooding caused by tropical cyclones (hurricanes) and extratropical cyclones (nor'easters) pose a threat to communities along the Atlantic coast of the United States. Climate change and sea level rise are altering the statistics of these extreme events in a rather complex fashion. Here we use a fully coupled global weather/climate modeling system (GFDL CM4) to study characteristics of extreme daily sea level (ESL) along the U.S. Atlantic coast and their response to global warming. We find that under natural weather processes, the Gulf of Mexico coast is most vulnerable to storm surge and related ESL. New Orleans is a striking hotspot with the highest surge efficiency in response to storm winds. Under a 1{\%} per year atmospheric CO 2 increase on centennial time scales, the anthropogenic signal in ESL is robust along the U.S. East Coast. It can emerge from the background variability as soon as in 20 years, or even before global sea level rise is taken into account. The regional dynamic sea level rise induced by the weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation facilitates this early emergence, especially during wintertime coastal flooding associated with nor'easters. Along the Gulf Coast, ESL is sensitive to the modification of hurricane characteristics under the CO 2 forcing. },

Unrealistic lake temperatures prescribed by the default WRF configuration cause obvious biases near the lakes and also affect predicted extremes hundreds of kilometers from the lakes, especially during winter. Using these default temperatures for the Great Lakes in winter creates a thermally induced wave in the modeled monthly average sea level pressure field, which reaches southern Florida. Differences of more than 0.5K in monthly average daily maximum 2-m temperature occur along that wave during winter. Noteworthy changes to temperature variability, precipitation, and mesoscale circulation also occur when the default method is used for downscaling. Consequently, improperly setting lake temperatures for downscaling could result in misinterpreting changes in regional climate and adversely affect applications reliant on downscaled data, even in areas remote from the lakes.},

This paper examines the effects of adding the atmospheric S2 forcing to a forward tide model. When the model is forced only by the gravitational potential, the S2 relative elevation error with respect to pelagic tide gauges is anomalously poor. After atmospheric S2 forcing is added, the relative error reduces to levels seen in other tidal constituents. In the global average, the atmospherically forced S2 ocean tide is 14.7 percent as large as the gravitationally forced S2 tide, and differs by about 109.4° in phase, consistent with the relative amplitudes and phases of the atmospheric and gravitational S2 forcings. Because the S2 air tide is periodic, the oceanic S2 tide represents a particularly clean test of the ability of numerical models to successfully replicate the oceanic response to atmospheric pressure loading.},

Storm surge in particular is largely influenced by coastal features such as topography/bathymetry and bottom roughness. Bottom roughness determines how much resistance there is to the flow. Manning's formula can be used to model the bottom stress with the Manning's n coefficient, a spatially dependent field. Given a storm surge model and a set of model outputs, an inverse problem may be solved to determine probable Manning's n fields to use for predictive simulations.The inverse problem is formulated and solved in a measure-theoretic framework using the state-of-the-art Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) storm surge model. The use of measure theory requires minimal assumptions and involves the direct inversion of the physics-based map from model inputs to output data determined by the ADCIRC model. Thus, key g...},

Both storm surges and heavy precipitation, as well as their interplay, are likely to change in response to global warming. Despite the CF relevance, a comprehensive hazard assessment beyond individual locations is missing, and no studies have examined CF in the future. Analyzing co-occurring high sea level and heavy precipitation in Europe, we show that the Mediterranean coasts are experiencing the highest CF probability in the present. However, future climate projections show emerging high CF probability along parts of the northern European coast. In several European regions, CF should be considered as a potential hazard aggravating the risk caused by mean sea level rise in the future.},

Bottom friction does not seem to affect the results at all. Wave celerity decreases during shoaling and slightly increases before breaking. At breaking, the crest particle velocity is almost horizontal and reaches 90{\%} of the crest celerity, which is two to three times larger than the bottom velocity. The nonlinear shallow water (NSW) equations and the Boussinesq approximation both fail to predict these results. Finally, shoaling rates for various wave heights and bottom slopes differ from the predictions of Green's or Boussinesq shoaling laws.

abstract = {In many areas, storm surges caused by tropical or extratropical cyclones are the main contributors to critical extreme sea level events. Storm surges can be simulated using numerical models that are based on the underlying physical processes, or by using data-driven models that quantify the relationship between the predictand (storm surge) and relevant predictors (wind speed, mean sea-level pressure, etc.). This study explores the potential of data-driven models to simulate storm surges globally. A multitude of predictors (obtained from remote sensing and climate reanalysis) along with predictands (from tide gage observations and storm surge reanalysis) are utilized to train and validate data-driven models to simulate daily maximum surge for the global coastline. Data-driven models simulate daily maximum surge better in extratropical and sub-tropical regions [average correlation and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.79 and 7.5 cm, respectively], than in the tropics (average correlation and RMSE of 0.45 and 5.3 cm, respectively). For extreme events, the average correlation decreases to 0.54 (0.33) and RMSE increases to 14.5 (13.1) cm for extratropical (tropical) regions. Models forced with remotely sensed predictors showed a slightly better performance (average correlation of 0.69) than models forced with predictors obtained from reanalysis products (average correlation of 0.68). Results also highlight a significant improvement (i.e., average correlation increases from 0.54 to 0.68; RMSE reduces from 11 to 7 cm) over the Global Tide and Surge Reanalysis (GTSR), derived from the only global hydrodynamic model. For approximately 70{\%} of tide gages, mean sea-level pressure is the most important predictor to model daily maximum surge. Our results highlight the added value of data-driven models in the context of simulating storm surges at the global scale, in addition to existing hydrodynamic numerical models.},

abstract = {Unstructured-grid models grounded on semi-implicit, finite-volume, Eulerian-Lagrangian algorithms, such as UnTRIM and ELCIRC, have enjoyed considerable success recently in simulating 3D estuarine and coastal circulation. However, opportunities for improving the accuracy of this type of models were identified during extensive simulations of a tightly coupled estuary-plume-shelf system in the Columbia River system. Efforts to improve numerical accuracy resulted in SELFE, a new finite-element model for cross-scale ocean modeling. SELFE retains key benefits, including computational efficiency of existing semi-implicit Eulerian-Lagrangian finite-volume models, but relaxes restrictions on grids, uses higher-order shape functions for elevation, and enables superior flexibility in representing the bathymetry. Better representation of the bathymetry is enabled by a novel, "localized" vertical grid that resembles unstructured grids. At a particular horizontal location, SELFE uses either S coordinates or SZ coordinates, but the equations are consistently solved in Z space. SELFE also performs well relative to volume conservation and spurious oscillations, two problems that plague some finite-element models. This paper introduces SELFE as an open-source code available for community use and enhancement. The main focus here is on describing the formulation of the model and on showing results for a range of progressively demanding benchmark tests. While leaving details to separate publications, we also briefly illustrate the superior performance of SELFE over ELCIRC in a field application to the Columbia River estuary and plume. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Meteotsunamis pose a unique threat to coastal communities and often lead to damage of coastal infrastructure, deluge of nearby property, and loss of life and injury. The Great Lakes are a known hot-spot of meteotsunami activity and serve as an important region for investigation of essential hydrodynamic processes and model forecast requirements in meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding. For this work, we developed an advanced hydrodynamic model and evaluate key model attributes and dynamic processes, including: (1) coastal model grid resolution and wetting and drying process in low-lying zones, (2) coastal infrastructure, including breakwaters and associated submerging and overtopping processes, (3) annual/seasonal (ambient) water level change, and (4) wind wave-current coupling. Numerical experiments are designed to evaluate the importance of these attributes to meteotsunami modeling, including a “representative storm” scenario in the context of regional climate change in which a meteotsunami wave is generated under high ambient lake-level conditions with a preferable wind direction and speed for wind-wave growth. Results demonstrate that accurate representation of coastal topography and fully resolving associated hydrodynamic processes are critical to forecasting the realistic hazards associated with meteotsunami events. As most of existing coastal forecast systems generally do not resolve many of these features due to insufficient model grid resolution or lack of essential model attributes, this work shows that calibrating or assessing existing forecast models against coastal water level gauges alone may result in underestimating the meteotsunami hazard, particularly when gauging stations are sparse and located behind harbor breakwaters or inside estuaries, which represent dampened or otherwise unrepresentative pictures of meteotsunami intensity. This work is the first hydrodynamic modeling of meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding for the Great Lakes, and serves as a template to guide where resources may be most beneficial in forecast system development and implementation.},

abstract = {Operational forecasting systems are important for disaster risk reduction. In this work we implement a coupled storm surge and tidal model on an unstructured grid over Europe towards the development of a pan-European Storm Surge Forecasting System (EU-SSF). The skill to predict tidal, surge and total water levels was evaluated based on measurements from 208 tidal gauge stations. Results show satisfactory performance for the two atmospheric forcing datasets tested, a High Resolution Forecast and ERA-INTERIM reanalysis, both provided by the European Center for Medium range Weather Forecast. For tidal predictions, the total RSS is equal to 0.197 m, lower than the values estimated by the global tidal model FES2004, and outperformed only by FES2012 (RSS = 0.05 m), which however is a product of data assimilation. Storm surge validation results show good predictive skill, with 0.04 m {\textless} RMSE {\textless} 0.21 m and {\%}RMSE within 4{\%}–22{\%}. Coupling with tides results in improved storm surge level predictions, with RMSE reducing by up to 0.033 m. The areas benefiting most from the coupling are the North Sea and the English Channel, resulting in up to 2{\%} reduction of the {\%}RMSE. Increasing the resolution of atmospheric forcing also improves the predictive skill, leading to a reduction of RMSE up to 0.06 m in terms of the extremes, especially in shallow areas where wind is the main driver for surge production. We propose a setup for operational pan-European storm surge forecasting combining tidal levels from the FES2012 model and storm surge residuals from the EU-SSF setup which couples meteorological and astronomic tides.},

abstract = {A two-way coupled long wave to Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) wave model named 2CLOWNS is introduced in this study and its numerical procedure is described in detail. The model is applied to solitary wave transformation and breaking on plane beaches with slopes 1/100, 1/60, 1/35 and 1/20. Two-way coupling was verified for test cases of pure solitary wave reflection on a flat bed, and wave transformation on slopes including rundown. The algorithm becomes sufficiently robust when a no gradient boundary condition on the vertical velocities is applied, the local wave height and slope are sufficiently small, and the coupling depths are sufficiently large. Suggested limits to the local wave height and slope are outlined. Characteristics of shoaling prior to breaking are analysed in detail for the long wave model. Optimal depths for coupling to the RANS model are found that approximately correspond to the transition from gradual shoaling to rapid shoaling. An expression that estimates this location is presented based on a nondimensional slope parameter. Overall, 2CLOWNS is shown to approximate shoaling and breaking characteristics in comparison with theory, physical experiments and other numerical analyses. The post-breaking behaviour and wave shape approximate theoretical descriptions and experimental observations including the touchdown of the plunging jet and resulting splashup. Velocity profiles are shown to be considerably different to ones based on depth-integrated models just prior to wave breaking and thereafter. 2CLOWNS allows for more reliable simulations when computing wave propagation from far offshore towards the coast in reduced computational time compared with full RANS simulations under the appropriate conditions outlined in this study.},

abstract = {A positive impact of adding directional information to observations from the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYNGSS) constellation of microsatellites is observed in simulation using a high-resolution nature run of an Atlantic hurricane for a 4-day period. Directional information is added using a two-dimensional variational analysis method (VAM) for near-surface vector winds that blends simulated CYGNSS wind speeds with an a priori background vector wind field at 6-h analysis times. The resulting wind vectors at CYGNSS data locations are more geophysically self-consistent when using high-resolution 6-h forecast backgrounds from a Hurricane Weather Research and Forecast Model (HWRF) control observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) compared to low-resolution 6-h forecasts from an associated Global Forecast System (GFS) model control OSSE. An important contributing factor is the large displacement error in the center of circulation in the GFS background wind fields that produces asymmetric circulations in the associated VAM analyses. Results of a limited OSSE indicate that CYGNSS winds reduce forecast error in hurricane intensity in 0-48-h forecasts compared to using no CYGNSS data. Assimilation of VAM-CYGNSS vector winds reduces maximum wind speed error by 2-5 kt (1 kt = 0.51 m s-1) and reduces minimum central pressure error by 2-5 hPa. The improvement in forecast intensity is notably larger and more consistent than the reduction in track error. The assimilation of VAM-CYGNSS wind vectors constrains analyses of surface wind field structures during OSSE more effectively than wind speeds alone. Because of incomplete sampling and the limitations of the data assimilation system used, CYGNSS scalar winds produce unwanted wind/pressure imbalances and asymmetries more often than the assimilation of VAM-CYGNSS data.},

abstract = {The bottom friction coefficient (BFC) is critical for precisely determining hydrodynamic conditions and sediment transport rates, which are important for scientific research and coastal ocean engineering. The BFC varies spatially and temporally, as indicated by in situ observations, but it is difficult to accurately set this parameter in tidal models. In this study, based on a two-dimensional multi-constituent tidal model and its adjoint model, the harmonic constants of four principal tidal constituents (M2, S2, K1, and O1) obtained from TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data were assimilated to estimate spatially and temporally varying BFCs using the adjoint method in the Bohai, Yellow, and East China Seas. The model performance was significantly improved after data assimilation, which was independently tested by harmonic constants at coastal tidal gauge stations. Through several sensitivity experiments, the spatial distributions of the temporally averaged BFCs were verified to be robust and not affected by model settings, while the temporal variations of the spatially averaged BFCs were also robust but related to the tidal constituents. The variations in the estimated BFCs with the current speed and water depth were nearly consistent with those in the observations. Overall, the temporal and spatial variations in the estimated BFCs are significantly correlated with the current speed and water depth, which is attributed to the erosion-deposition of sediment on the seabed and the changes in seabed roughness under different current speeds. The results can be beneficial for determining reasonable parameters for the bottom stress and setting the BFC in multi-constituent tidal models.},

abstract = {Nearly all generalized wave continuity (GWC)-based models utilize the velocity-based, non-conservative form of the momentum equation to obtain the depth-averaged changes in velocity. It has been hypothesized that a flux-based, conservative form of the momentum equation may improve accuracy and stability. Herein, we study the impact of the choice of dependent variable and form of the momentum equation in a GWC-based finite element shallow water model. The impact of this change on mass balance, stability, and accuracy (spatial and temporal) is rigorously assessed, first for 1D barotropic flows and then for 2D barotropic flows in a variety of basins. Both 1D and 2D results indicate that the conservative form improves mass balance on both global and local scales, with the most significant gains found in local mass balance in areas with steep bathymetry gradients. This is also the region where the conservative form shows an increase in local spatial accuracy. Taylor series analysis and numerical simulations indicate a strong correlation between local spatial truncation errors and local mass balance errors. Stability, temporal accuracy and global spatial accuracy do not show statistically significant changes between the two algorithms in both 1D and 2D studies. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this study, effects of meteorological product, wind drag coefficient, and the bottom drag coefficient on the modelling storm surge in the East China Sea were investigated by using a high-resolution model based on FVCOM (Finite Volume Community Ocean Model). The model was first evaluated against the observational storm surge caused by Typhoon Winnie; the sensitivities of modelling surge variations to different factors were then examined, including four different meteorological products (ERA-Interim, ERA5, CCMP, NCEP-CFSR), seven formulae of wind drag coefficient (Peng {\&} Li, Large {\&} Pond, Garratt, Wu, Large {\&} Yeager, Edson, and Zijlema), and six cases of bottom drag coefficient. The results indicated that all the experiments could capture temporal variations of the surge elevations. However, NCEP-CFSR wind field performs the best among the four wind field products. The wind drag coefficient formulae of Large {\&} Yeager produce better results than the other formulae. The formulae of Edson, Wu, and Garratt produce higher surge elevations than those of the Large {\&} Pond and Zijlema at the time of peak surge. Decreasing the bottom friction has a greater impact on surge elevations and current velocities than increasing the bottom friction. The non-linear interaction between tides and surge was studied as well, and the results showed that the non-linear effect contributed by 37{\%} to the peak surge. The best combination of wind field and parameters derived from the sensitivity studies was used for the other three different storms (Chan-Hom, Herb and Mireille), and the simulations indicated that the best combination of forcing and drag coefficient obtained in this study in general can improve the performance of storm surge models.},

abstract = {A global high-resolution ocean circulation model forced by atmospheric fields and the M2 tidal constituent is used to explore plausible scenarios for the damping of low-mode internal tides. The plausibil- ity of different damping scenarios is tested by comparing the modeled barotropic tides with TPXO8, a highly accurate satellite-altimetry-constrained tide model, and by comparing the modeled coherent baro- clinic tide amplitudes against along-track altimetry. Five scenarios are tested: (1) a topographic internal wave drag, argued here to represent the breaking of unresolved high vertical modes, applied to the bottom flow (default configuration), (2) a wave drag applied to the barotropic flow, (3) absence of wave drag, (4) a substantial increase in quadratic bottom friction along the continental shelves (with wave drag turned off), and (5) application of wave drag to the barotropic flow at the same time that quadratic bottom friction is substantially increased along the shelves. Of the scenarios tested here, the default configuration (1) yields the most accurate tides. In all other scenarios (2–5), the lack of damping on open ocean baroclinic motions yields baroclinic tides that are too energetic and travel too far from their sources, despite the presence of a vigorous mesoscale eddy field which can scatter and decohere internal tides in the model. The barotropic tides are also less accurate in the absence of an open ocean damping on barotropic motions, that is, in sce- narios (3) and (4). The results presented here suggest that low-mode internal tides experience substantial damping in the open ocean. C},

abstract = {In order to accommodate the computational burden of high-fidelity storm surge numerical models, surrogate modeling (metamodeling) techniques have gained significant popularity over the past decade. Utilizing an existing database of synthetic storm simulations, these models provide a fast-to-compute mathematical approximation to the input/output relationship of the numerical model that was used to establish this database. Thus, they offer fast predictions and, when properly calibrated, can maintain the accuracy of the high-fidelity numerical model that generated the original database. This study extends the previous work of the authors and investigates different computational aspects for incorporating Sea Level Rise (SLR) explicitly as an input within such a surrogate modeling framework. Kriging, also referenced as Gaussian process regression, is specifically chosen as the surrogate modeling technique for this study. The storms utilized correspond to a database of 300 synthetic tropical cyclones recently developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers Coastal Hazards System for the Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands region, which considers three different SLR scenarios. The development of separate surrogate models for each of the three SLR scenarios and of a single surrogate model that predicts across all SLR scenarios are compared, addressing several relevant issues like (1) the proper definition of validation metrics (2) the correct implementation of cross-validation techniques, and (3) the need for adjustment of the surrogate model hyper-parameter calibration. It is shown that proper attention is needed when the same storms have been considered across all the different SLR scenarios in the database; otherwise, the calibration of the surrogate model may be ineffective, and the validation of its accuracy will provide erroneous confidence. The proper normalization of the storm surge output to improve the surrogate model accuracy is also discussed. Finally, the proper selection of storm simulations for establishing the database for the surrogate model development is examined, emphasizing how this selection should be performed efficiently across the different SLR scenarios. It is demonstrated that high surrogate model accuracy can be accommodated with a small number of strategically chosen storm simulations. Leveraging this investigation, recommendations are offered on how to efficiently create future high-fidelity databases to support the development of surrogate models that predict across different SLR scenarios.},

abstract = {A region of freshwater influence (ROFI) under hypertidal conditions is used to demonstrate inherent problems for nested operational modelling systems. Such problems can impact the accurate simulation of freshwater export within shelf seas, so must be considered in coastal ocean modelling studies. In Liverpool Bay (our UK study site), freshwater inflow from 3 large estuaries forms a coastal front that moves in response to tides and winds. The cyclic occurrence of stratification and remixing is important for the biogeochemical cycles, as nutrient and pollutant loaded freshwater is introduced into the coastal system. Validation methods, using coastal observations from fixed moorings and cruise transects, are used to assess the simulation of the ROFI, through improved spatial structure and temporal variability of the front, as guidance for best practise model setup. A structured modelling system using a 180 m grid nested within a 1.8 km grid demonstrates how compensation for error at the coarser resolution can have an adverse impact on the nested, high resolution application. Using 2008, a year of typical calm and stormy periods with variable river influence, the sensitivities of the ROFI dynamics to initial and boundary conditions are investigated. It is shown that accurate representation of the initial water column structure is important at the regional scale and that the boundary conditions are most important at the coastal scale. Although increased grid resolution captures the frontal structure, the accuracy in frontal position is determined by the offshore boundary conditions and therefore the accuracy of the coarser regional model.},

abstract = {A range of computer science methods termed machine learning (ML)enables the extraction of insight and quantitative relationships from multidimensional datasets. Here, we review the use of ML on supervised regression tasks in studies of coastal morphodynamics and sediment transport. We examine aspects of ‘what' and ‘why', such as ‘what' science problems ML tools have been used to address, ‘what' was learned when using ML, and ‘why' authors used ML methods. We find a variety of research questions have been addressed, ranging from small-scale predictions of sediment transport to larger-scale sand bar morphodynamics and coastal overwash on a developed island. We find various reasons justify the use of ML, including maximize predictability, emulation of model components, the need for smooth and continuous nonlinear regression, and explicit inclusion of uncertainty. The expanding use of ML has allowed for an expanding set of questions to be addressed. After reviewing the studies we outline a set of best practices for coastal researchers using machine learning methods. Finally we suggest possible areas for future research, including the use of novel machine learning techniques and exploring open data that is becoming increasingly available.},

abstract = {This paper describes NHWAVE, a shock-capturing non-hydrostatic model for simulating wave refraction, diffraction, shoaling, breaking and landslide-generated tsunami in finite water depth. The governing equations are the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in conservative form, written in surface and terrain-following form using a $\sigma$ coordinate. In order to apply a Godunov-type scheme, the velocities are defined at cell centers. The dynamic pressure is defined at vertically facing cell faces so that the pressure boundary condition at free surface can be precisely imposed. The HLL Riemann approximation is employed to estimate fluxes at horizontal cell faces. The nonlinear Strong Stability-Preserving (SSP) Runge–Kutta scheme is used to obtain second-order accuracy in time. The model is validated using seven test cases based on analytical solutions and experimental data. The computed results show that the model can well predict wave propagation over submerged bar, wave refraction and diffraction over an elliptical shoal as well as wave breaking, run-up and longshore current on a plane beach using relatively few (three to five) vertical layers. The model is also shown to provide accurate reproduction of a generated tsunami wave resulting from a solid translating bottom feature.},

abstract = {In preparation for the launch of the NASA Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), a variety of observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) were conducted to develop, tune, and assess methods of assimilating these novel observations of ocean surface winds. From a highly detailed and realistic hurricane nature run (NR), CYGNSS winds were simulated with error characteristics that are expected to occur in reality. The OSSE system makes use of NOAA's HWRF Model and GSI data assimilation system in a configuration that was operational in 2012. CYGNSS winds were assimilated as scalar wind speeds and as wind vectors determined by a variational analysis method (VAM). Both forms of wind information had positive impacts on the short-term HWRF forecasts, as shown by key storm and domain metrics. Data assimilation cycle intervals of 1, 3, and 6 h were tested, and the 3-h impacts were consistently best. One-day forecasts from CYGNSS VAM vector winds were the most dynamically consistent with the NR. The OSSEs have a number of limitations; the most noteworthy is that this is a case study, and static background error covariances were used.},

abstract = {The energy flux out of barotropic tides and into internal waves (“conversion”) is computed using a global domain multi-layer numerical model. The solution is highly baroclinic and reveals a global field of internal waves radiating way from generation sites of rough topography. A small number of sites where intense internal wave generation occurs accounts for most of the globally integrated work done on the barotropic tide and dominates sites such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge. The globally integrated conversion of the M2 barotropic tide is 891 Gigawatts and the globally integrated rate of working of the ocean by astronomical forcing is 2.94 Terawatts. Both of these estimates are close to accepted values derived from independent methods. Regional estimates of conversion are also similar to previous inferences, lending additional confidence that the solution has captured the essential physics of low-mode internal wave generation and that numerical prediction of conversion has skill in regions where no previous estimates are available.},

abstract = {In this study, a 9.6 million node large-scale unstructured grid finite-element forward barotropic model is de- veloped and applied to understand the tidal dynamics and dissipation mechanisms of the Indian and western Pacific Oceans down to sub-kilometer scale at the coast. Tidal model-data comparisons are presented to assess the capabilities and limitations of our large-scale barotropic model. The average root-mean-square (RMS) dis- crepancies of tidal elevations at coastal tide gauges is 14 cm, which is ∼3 cm smaller than those of a state-of- the-art global data assimilated barotropic tidal model. Sensitivities to lateral boundary conditions, bathymetry, and dissipative processes are explored to guide future endeavors related to large-scale barotropic modeling in the region and other regions throughout the world. Lateral boundary conditions are found to induce adverse re- sonant effects on the lunar semi-diurnal modes when poorly placed elevation specified boundary conditions are used. This problem is largely resolved by using an absorption-generation layer at the boundary. Parameterization of internal tide energy conversion is identified as the most important aspect to control deep water solutions, and help reduce the RMS discrepancies of the entire system. Two forms of this parameterization are presented and their spatial distributions of dissipation are compared. Bathymetry has a negligible effect on the tidal solutions in deep water, but local high resolution bathymetry results in significant reductions to the average RMS dis- crepancies on the continental shelf (26{\%}) and at the coast (30{\%}). Implementing a spatially varying bottom friction coefficient based on sediment types decreases the average RMS discrepancy at the coast by 9{\%} pre- dominantly due to its positive effects in the Yellow Sea. The model is shown to capture a large amount of the tidal physics and has the potential for application to a range of barotropic problems such as wind-driven surge and tidal processes. 1.},

abstract = {Dynamical downscaling with high-resolution regional climate models may offer the possibility of realistically reproducing precipitation and weather events in climate simulations. As resolutions fall to order kilometers, the use of explicit rather than parametrized convection may offer even greater fidelity. However, these increased resolutions both allow and require increasingly complex diagnostics for evaluating model fidelity. In this study we focus on precipitation evaluation and analyze five 2-month-long dynamically downscaled model runs over the continental United States that employ different convective and microphysics parameterizations, including one high-resolution convection-permitting simulation. All model runs use the Weather Research and Forecasting Model driven by National Center for Environmental Prediction reanalysis data. We show that employing a novel rainstorm identification and tracking algorithm that allocates essentially all rainfall to individual precipitation events (Chang et al. in J Clim 29(23):8355–8376, 2016) allows new insights into model biases. Results include that, at least in these runs, model wet bias is driven by excessive areal extent of individual precipitating events, and that the effect is time-dependent, producing excessive diurnal cycle amplitude. This amplified cycle is driven not by new production of events but by excessive daytime enlargement of long-lived precipitation events. We further show that in the domain average, precipitation biases appear best represented as additive offsets. Of all model configurations evaluated, convection-permitting simulations most consistently reduced biases in precipitation event characteristics.},

abstract = {Wind turbine wakes are the result of the extraction of kinetic energy from the incoming atmospheric wind exerted from a wind turbine rotor. Therefore, the reduced mean velocity and enhanced turbulence intensity within the wake are affected by the characteristics of the incoming wind, turbine blade aerodynamics, and the turbine control settings. In this work, LiDAR measurements of isolated wakes generated by wind turbines installed at an onshore wind farm are leveraged to characterize the variability of the wake mean velocity and turbulence intensity during typical operations encompassing a breadth of atmospheric stability regimes, levels of power capture, and, in turn, rotor thrust coefficients. For the statistical analysis of the wake velocity fields, the LiDAR measurements are clustered through a k-means algorithm, which enables to identify of the most representative realizations of the wind turbine wakes while avoiding the imposition of thresholds for the various wind and turbine parameters, which can be biased by preconceived, and potentially incorrect, notions. Considering the large number of LiDAR samples collected to probe the wake velocity field over the horizontal plane at hub height, the dimensionality of the experimental dataset is reduced by projecting the LiDAR data on an intelligently-truncated basis obtained with the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). The coefficients of only five physics-informed POD modes, which are considered sufficient to reproduce the observed wake variability, are then injected in the k-means algorithm for clustering the LiDAR dataset. The analysis of the clustered LiDAR data, and the associated SCADA and meteorological data, enables the study of the variability of the wake velocity deficit, wake extent, and wake-added turbulence intensity for different thrust coefficients of the turbine rotor and regimes of atmospheric stability.},

abstract = {Coastal inundation due to sea level rise (SLR) is projected to displace hundreds of millions of people worldwide over the next century, creating significant economic, humanitarian, and national-security challenges. However, the majority of previous efforts to characterize potential coastal impacts of climate change have focused primarily on long-term SLR with a static tide level, and have not comprehensively accounted for dynamic physical drivers such as tidal non-linearity, storms, short-term climate variability, erosion response and consequent flooding responses. Here we present a dynamic modeling approach that estimates climate-driven changes in flood-hazard exposure by integrating the effects of SLR, tides, waves, storms, and coastal change (i.e. beach erosion and cliff retreat). We show that for California, USA, the world's 5 th largest economy, over {\$}150 billion of property equating to more than 6{\%} of the state's GDP and 600,000 people could be impacted by dynamic flooding by 2100; a three-fold increase in exposed population than if only SLR and a static coastline are considered. The potential for underestimating societal exposure to coastal flooding is greater for smaller SLR scenarios, up to a seven-fold increase in exposed population and economic interests when considering storm conditions in addition to SLR. These results highlight the importance of including climate-change driven dynamic coastal processes and impacts in both short-term hazard mitigation and long-term adaptation planning.},

The experiments are repeated with four uniform and sixteen irregular triangular grids. The results show that the quality of the coastal tide simulation depends primarily on the coastal resolution and that the ocean interior can be resolved up to twenty times lower without causing considerable reductions in quality. The mesh transition zones between areas of different resolutions are formed by cell bisection and subsequent local spring optimisation tolerating a triangular cell's maximum angle up to 84°. Numerical problems with these high-grade non-equiangular cells were not encountered. The results emphasise the numerical feasibility and potential efficiency of highly irregular computational meshes used by ICON-O.},

The method generates a three-dimensional mesh which is optimised to approximate the bathymetry to a user-specified accuracy, which itself may be defined as a function of space and bathymetry. To do this a mesh optimisation method is employed which allows the formation of highly anisotropic elements aligned with bathymetric variations of high curvature.

abstract = {Extratropical cyclones (ETCs) are responsible for most of the large storm-surge events in the northeastern United States. This study uses the ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the twentieth century (ERA-20C) and NOAA tide gauge data to examine the local, regional, and large-scale atmospheric circulation accompanying the 100 largest ETC-driven surge events at three locations along the northeastern coast of the United States: Sewells Point (Norfolk), Virginia; the Battery (New York City), New York; and Boston, Massachusetts. Results from a k-means cluster analysis indicate that the largest surges are generated when slowly propagating ETCs encounter a strong anticyclone, which produces a tighter pressure gradient and longer duration of onshore winds. The strength of the anticyclone is evident in the middle and upper troposphere where there are positive 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies overlying the surface anticyclone for the majority of clusters and nearly all of the five biggest surge events. Multiple clusters feature a slower-than-average storm and a strong anticyclone, indicating that various circulation scenarios can produce a large storm surge. This favorable environment for large surge events is influenced by well-known modes of climate variability including El Ni{\~{n}}o, the Arctic Oscillation (AO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern. ETCs are more likely to produce a large surge during El Ni{\~{n}}o conditions, which have been shown to enhance the East Coast storm track. At Boston and the Battery, maximum surge occurs preferentially during the positive phase of PNA and the negative phases of AO/NAO.},

abstract = {The objective of the present work is to discuss the implementation of an active wave generating-absorbing boundary condition for a numerical model based on the Volume Of Fluid (VOF) method for tracking free surfaces. First an overview of the development of VOF type models with special emphasis in the field of coastal engineering is given. A new type of numerical boundary condition for combined wave generation and absorption in the numerical model VOFbreak2 is presented. The numerical boundary condition is based on an active wave absorption system that was first developed in the context of physical wave flume experiments, using a wave paddle. The method applies to regular and irregular waves. Velocities are measured at one location inside the computational domain. The reflected wave train is separated from the incident wave field in front of a structure by means of digital filtering and subsequent superposition of the measured velocity signals. The incident wave signal is corrected, so that the reflected wave is effectively absorbed at the boundary. The digital filters are derived theoretically and their practical design is discussed. The practical use of this numerical boundary condition is compared to the use of the absorption system in a physical wave flume. The effectiveness of the active wave generating absorbing boundary condition finally is proved using analytical tests and numerical simulations with VOFbreak2.},

abstract = {The present study explores how midlatitude winter cyclone activity can be modified under warming-induced conditions due to enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations. We performed simulations with the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM version 3.5) implemented on a domain that covers the Northwest Atlantic and eastern North America. These simulations are driven by control conditions (1975-1994) and high-CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} scenario conditions (2040-2059) suggested by the Canadian Climate Centre model, CGCM2 (Second Generation Coupled Global Climate Model), following the IPCC IS92a scenario. Comparisons between model simulations for the control period (1975-1994) and North America Regional analysis (NARR) suggest that both CGCM2 and CRCM reliably reproduce the overall NARR patterns of sea level pressure, tropospheric baroclinicity and Atlantic storm tracks. However, compared to CGCM2 results, CRCM offers an improvement in simulations of the most intense cyclones. Although both models underestimate the track density of intense cyclones, the CGCM2 underestimates are larger than those of CRCM. Under the high-CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} climate change scenario, the CRCM and CGCM2 model simulations show similar changes in sea level pressure, surface temperature, and total track density of midlatitude winter cyclones. Although we can see the northwest shift of the dominant Atlantic storm track, it is not statistically significant. Moreover, simulations from both models show a decrease in the total cyclone track density along the Canadian east coast; the decrease is more robust in CRCM simulations than in CGCM2 results. For intense cyclones, CRCM simulations show a slight decrease in the track density, while no such change is found in CGCM2 simulations.},

abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of the airflow over periodic traveling waves were performed to investigate the applicability of two mechanisms related to momentum transfer from the turbulent airflow to the traveling waves, i.e., the critical-layer mechanism and the nonseparated sheltering. We found three regimes classified by the wave age. In the first regime at low wave ages (2 ≤ c/u* ≤ 4), the critical height is located in the thin inner region where nonseparated sheltering works, and the perturbations of the shear stress in the inner region directly affect the streamwise phase of pressure on the wave surface. In the second regime at intermediate wave ages (4 {\textless} c/u* ≤ 12), the critical layer is located in the thick inner region and has a strong link to momentum transfer across the interfacial wave. In particular, the phase of wave-induced pressure on the wave surface $\phi$p̃bot is determined by the phase of wave-induced vertical velocity at the critical height $\phi$w̃z=zc as $\phi$p̃bot ≈$\phi$w̃z=zc + $\pi$/2. In this regime, the growth rate of the interfacial wave is predicted well by the critical-layer mechanism. In the third regime at high wave ages (c/u* ≥ 16), the critical height is in the outer region far above the inner region, and the assumption of the critical-layer mechanism is better satisfied. However, momentum transfer across the interface in this regime is determined mainly by the local flow in the inner region and it is only weakly affected by the flow at the critical height. Then, the nonseparated sheltering works also at this high wave age. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

This suggests that it is not always effective to shelter containers near the seawall before large tsunamis. In addition, it is not evident that the container initially set perpendicular to the quay wall drifts seaward, suggesting that an effective countermeasure would be to store containers on the apron in the cross-shore direction.},

abstract = {Driven by high-resolution NAM (North America Mesoscale) and ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) atmospheric fields, a 3-D unstructured grid SCHISM (Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model) was applied to simulate total water level in the Mid-Atlantic Bight during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The simulated storm surge, tide, significant wave height, and wave peak period results compared favorably with NOAA observations along US East Coast, Long Island Sound, and New York Harbor. The maximum total water level at The Battery in the New York Harbor was accurately simulated with an absolute error of less than 0.08 m (out of 2.9 m peak surge) and a timing difference less than 10 min, which includes the effects on the order of 0.1–0.3 m (5–10{\%}) from the coastal setup induced by the surface waves. The scenario comparisons of (1) “NAM” versus “ECMWF”, (2) “2-D” versus “3-D”, and (3) “with” versus “without” wind wave model were examined. The 3-D barotropic model forced by ECMWF including the effects of wind waves performs the best, attributed to wave-induced radiation stress and reduction of bottom stress when the 3-D version is used. Simultaneously, the ELCIRC-Sub model, using a 5-m topography/bathymetry sub-grid and a regular 200-m resolution finite volume computational model grid, was developed to simulate the street-level inundation in New York City. The momentum and mass fluxes calculated by the coarser base grid model were effectively coupled with the sub-grid so that running a full-blown high-resolution base model is not required. The ELCIRC-Sub model uses MPI (Message Passing Interface) parallel computing to enlarge the coverage of the land surface and an efficient non-linear solver to improve the accuracy of the wetting-and-drying processes. The temporal comparisons of modeled water level with NOAA's tidal stations and USGS′ rapid-deployed gauges showed overall performance with an average error of 0.1 m. Particularly, ELCIRC-Sub captured the profile of the highest peak surge (3.9 m), which rose 2 m within 3 hour at Kings Point, NY. The spatial comparisons of the modeled peak water level at 80 surveyed locations showed an average error less than 0.13 m. The modeled maximum inundation extent also matched well with an 80{\%} hit rate against FEMA's Hurricane Sandy maximum flooding extent.},

abstract = {Sea-level rise will radically redefine the coastline of the 21st century. For many coastal regions, projections of global sea-level rise by the year 2100 (e.g., 0.5–2 meters) are comparable in magnitude to today's extreme but short-lived increases in water level due to storms. Thus, the 21st century will see significant changes to coastal flooding regimes (where present-day, extreme-but-rare events become common), which poses a major risk to the safety and sustainability of coastal communities worldwide. So far, estimates of future coastal flooding frequency focus on endpoint scenarios, such as the increase in flooding by 2050 or 2100. Here, we investigate the continuous shift in coastal flooding regimes by quantifying continuous rates of increase in the occurrence of extreme water-level events due to sea-level rise. We find that the odds of exceeding critical water-level thresholds increases exponentially with sea-level rise, meaning that fixed amounts of sea-level rise of only {\~{}}1–10 cm in areas with a narrow range of present-day extreme water levels can double the odds of flooding. Combining these growth rates with established sea-level rise projections, we find that the odds of extreme flooding double approximately every 5 years into the future. Further, we find that the present-day 50-year extreme water level (i.e., 2{\%} annual chance of exceedance, based on historical records) will be exceeded annually before 2050 for most (i.e., 70{\%}) of the coastal regions in the United States. Looking even farther into the future, the present-day 50-year extreme water level will be exceeded almost every day during peak tide (i.e., daily mean higher high water) before the end of the 21st century for 90{\%} of the U.S. coast. Our findings underscore the need for immediate planning and adaptation to mitigate the societal impacts of future flooding.},

abstract = {A recent advance in the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) is described and used to study two-way air-sea coupling and its impact on two different weather scenarios. The first case examines the impact of a hurricane-induced cold ocean wake on simulated changes in the structure of Hurricane Katrina. The second case investigates the effect of wind- and current-induced island wakes and their impact on the local electromagnetic (EM) and acoustic propagation characteristics in the Southern California Bight region. In the Katrina case, both the atmosphere and ocean show a strong response from air- sea interaction. The model results show that wind-induced turbulent mixing, vertical advection, and horizontal advection are the three primary causes of the development of the trailing cold ocean wake. A distinct spatial separation is seen in these three primary forcing terms that are generating the bulk of the cooling in the ocean mixed layer. An asymmetric tropical cyclone structure change has been documented in detail from a more realistic, full physics, and tightly coupled model. These changes include a broadening of the eye, a reduced radius of hurricane-force wind, and a pronounced inner-core dry slot on the west side of the storm. In the island wake experiment, many finescale variations in the wind, current, and static stability structure resulting from the two-way interaction are described. These variations take the form of narrow vorticity and temperature anomalies that are found to reside in the ocean and atmosphere well downwind from the Channel Islands. Upwind differences in the lower-atmospheric wind and thermal structure also arise and are found to have a small impact on the lee-flow structure and EM characteristics of the southernmost Channel Islands. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

The measured data are employed to re-examine existing formulae that include breaking criterion, amplitude evolution and run-up height. The properties of shoreline motion, underwater particle velocity and scale effect on run-up height are briefly discussed. Based on our analyses, it is evidently found that there exist five zones during a wave amplitude evolution course on the present mild slope. A simple formula which is capable of predicting maximum run-up height for a breaking solitary wave on a uniform beach with a wide range of beach slope (1:15–1:60) is also proposed. The calculated results from the present model agree favorably with available laboratory data, indicating that our method is compatible with other predictive models.},

abstract = {The Princeton environment-dependent probabilistic tropical cyclone (PepC) model is developed for generating synthetic tropical cyclones (TCs) to support TC risk assessment. PepC consists of three components: a hierarchical Poisson genesis model, an analog-wind track model, and a Markov intensity model. The three model components are dependent on environmental variables that vary with the climate, including potential intensity, advection flow, vertical wind shear, relative humidity, and ocean-cooling parameters. The present model is developed for the North Atlantic Basin. The three model components and the integrated model are verified against observations using out-of-sample testing. The model can generally capture the TC climatology and reproduce statistics of TC genesis, movement, rapid intensification, and lifetime maximum intensity, as well as local landfall frequency and intensity. It can be coupled with climate models and TC hazard models to quantify TC-related wind, surge, and rainfall risks under various climate conditions. The modeling framework can be further improved when more relevant environmental variables are identified and become available in climate model outputs.},

abstract = {The impact of changing climate on terrestrial and underwater archaeological sites, historic buildings, and cultural landscapes can be examined through quantitatively-based analyses encompassing large data samples and broad geographic and temporal scales. The Digital Index of North American Archaeology (DINAA) is a multi-institutional collaboration that allows researchers online access to linked heritage data from multiple sources and data sets. The effects of sea-level rise and concomitant human population relocation is examined using a sample from nine states encompassing much of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the southeastern United States. A 1 m rise in sea-level will result in the loss of over {\textgreater}13,000 recorded historic and prehistoric archaeological sites, as well as over 1000 locations currently eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), encompassing archaeological sites, standing structures, and other cultural properties. These numbers increase substantially with each additional 1 m rise in sea level, with {\textgreater}32,000 archaeological sites and {\textgreater}2400 NRHP properties lost should a 5 m rise occur. Many more unrecorded archaeological and historic sites will also be lost as large areas of the landscape are flooded. The displacement of millions of people due to rising seas will cause additional impacts where these populations resettle. Sea level rise will thus result in the loss of much of the record of human habitation of the coastal margin in the Southeast within the next one to two centuries, and the numbers indicate the magnitude of the impact on the archaeological record globally. Construction of large linked data sets is essential to developing procedures for sampling, triage, and mitigation of these impacts.},

abstract = {The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) project is an international effort to produce a comprehensive global atmospheric circulation dataset spanning the twentieth century, assimilating only surface pressure reports and using observed monthly sea-surface temperature and sea-ice distributions as boundary conditions. It is chiefly motivated by a need to provide an observational dataset with quantified uncertainties for validations of climate model simulations of the twentieth century on all time-scales, with emphasis on the statistics of daily weather. It uses an Ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation method with background 'first guess' fields supplied by an ensemble of forecasts from a global numerical weather prediction model. This directly yields a global analysis every 6 hours as the most likely state of the atmosphere, and also an uncertainty estimate of that analysis. The 20CR dataset provides the first estimates of global tropospheric variability, and of the dataset's time-varying quality, from 1871 to the present at 6-hourly temporal and 2° spatial resolutions. Intercomparisons with independent radiosonde data indicate that the reanalyses are generally of high quality. The quality in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere throughout the century is similar to that of current three-day operational NWP forecasts. Intercomparisons over the second half-century of these surface-based reanalyses with other reanalyses that also make use of upper-air and satellite data are equally encouraging. It is anticipated that the 20CR dataset will be a valuable resource to the climate research community for both model validations and diagnostic studies. Some surprising results are already evident. For instance, the long-term trends of indices representing the North Atlantic Oscillation, the tropical Pacific Walker Circulation, and the Pacific-North American pattern are weak or non-existent over the full period of record. The long-term trends of zonally averaged precipitation minus evaporation also differ in character from those in climate model simulations of the twentieth century. {\textcopyright} 2011 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright.},

Therefore, the effect of breakwater protection against the 2011 tsunami is verified by comparing the different states of damage to breakwaters with numerical simulations. The results show that the protective effect provided by breakwaters against tsunami depends on the rate of opening gap, and suggest that this is an efficient way to improve the resiliency of deeper-region breakwater structures.},

abstract = {The devastating impact by Hurricane Sandy (2012) again showed New York City (NYC) is one of the most vulnerable cities to coastal flooding around the globe. The low-lying areas in NYC can be flooded by nor'easter storms and North Atlantic hurricanes. The few studies that have estimated potential flood damage for NYC base their damage estimates on only a single, or a few, possible flood events. The objective of this study is to assess the full distribution of hurricane flood risk in NYC. This is done by calculating potential flood damage with a flood damage model that uses many possible storms and surge heights as input. These storms are representative for the low-probability/high-impact flood hazard faced by the city. Exceedance probability-loss curves are constructed under different assumptions about the severity of flood damage. The estimated flood damage to buildings for NYC is between US{\$}59 and 129 millions/year. The damage caused by a 1/100-year storm surge is within a range of US{\$}2 bn-5 bn, while this is between US{\$}5 bn and 11 bn for a 1/500-year storm surge. An analysis of flood risk in each of the five boroughs of NYC finds that Brooklyn and Queens are the most vulnerable to flooding. This study examines several uncertainties in the various steps of the risk analysis, which resulted in variations in flood damage estimations. These uncertainties include: the interpolation of flood depths; the use of different flood damage curves; and the influence of the spectra of characteristics of the simulated hurricanes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society for Risk Analysis.},

abstract = {The successful implementation of a finite element model for computing shallow-water flow requires the identification and spatial discretization of a surface water region. Since no robust criterion or node spacing routine exists, which incorporates physical characteristics and subsequent responses into the mesh generation process, modelers are left to rely on crude gridding criteria as well as their knowledge of particular domains and their intuition. Two separate methods to generate a finite element mesh are compared for the Gulf of Mexico. A wavelength-based criterion and an alternative approach, which employs a localized truncation error analysis (LTEA), are presented. Both meshes have roughly the same number of nodes, although the distribution of these nodes is very different. Two-dimensional depth-averaged simulations of flow using a linearized form of the generalized wave continuity equation and momentum equations are performed with the LTEA-based mesh and the wavelength-to-gridsize ratio mesh. All simulations are forced with a single tidal constituent, M2. Use of the LTEA-based procedure is shown to produce a superior (i.e., less error) two-dimensional grid because the physics of shallow-water flow, as represented by discrete equations, are incorporated into the mesh generation process.

abstract = {A key problem in the decadal morphodynamic modelling of tidal inlet system is on the evolution of the inlet channels, especially the unrealistic channel incision. The present study attempts to couple two processes, including the bedform roughness and sediment grain-size sorting, in the two-dimensional, depth-averaged process-based model to solve the problem. Based on the comparison of the modelling results and relevant field observations in the Dutch Wadden Sea, it is suggested that bedform roughness height predictor is a useful tool for determining spatial and temporal heterogeneous bed frictions. Within tidal channels, bedform roughness is dominated by dune roughness. In order to represent “the memory of old bedforms”, a relaxation time method was implemented. The corresponding large relaxation time (2 M2 tidal periods) smooths the tidal variations of dune roughness, and makes it respond to hydrodynamic changes on a longer time scale. When decadal morphological modelling is carried out, the model performance can be significantly improved by introducing either bedform (dune) roughness predictor or sediment sorting processes. The mechanisms are twofold. First, in the deep channels where flow velocities are high, large dunes develop and cause large bed drag coefficients. Second, coarser bed sediments within the channel area induced by sorting prevent the channel incision. If both effects are coupled in the morphodynamic modelling, the inlet channel incision is further controlled, which is not just a result of the linear superposition of both effects, because sorting can further promote the development of dunes within the deep channels.},

Within NEMO, the ocean engine is interfaced with a sea-ice model (SI 3 or CICE), passive tracers and biogeochemical models (TOP) and, via the OASIS coupler, with several atmospheric general circulation models. It also supports two-way grid embedding by means of the AGRIF software. The primitive equation model is adapted to regional and global ocean circulation problems down to kilometric scale. Prognostic variables are the three-dimensional velocity field, a non-linear sea surface height, the Conservative Temperature and the Absolute Salinity. In the horizontal direction, the model uses a curvilinear orthogonal grid and in the vertical direction, a full or partial step z-coordinate, or s-coordinate, or a mixture of the two. The distribution of variables is a three-dimensional Arakawa C-type grid. Various physical choices are available to describe ocean physics, so as various HPC functionalities to improve performances.

abstract = {Abstract Using linear wave theory, the rate at which energy is converted into internal gravity waves by the interaction of the barotropic tide with topography in an ocean is calculated. Bell's formula for the conversion rate is extended to the case of an ocean of finite depth H with weak two-dimensional topography h(x, y) and arbitrary buoyancy frequency N(z). Approximate solutions are computed using the WKB method, which reduce to the previous result for an ocean of infinite depth with constant stratification. The conversion rate for a finite-depth ocean can be substantially smaller than the infinite-ocean prediction when the length scale of the topography is of the same order as the horizontal wavelength of the internal tide. The conversion rate for two-dimensional Gaussian seamounts is calculated. Using observed statistics for the distribution of seamounts, the authors estimate 1/4 GW of conversion for a square of ocean floor of side 1000 km.},

Evaluating standing land structures and damage to them requires highly precise evaluation of three-dimensional fluid motion – an expensive process. Our research goals were thus to develop a coupling STOC method [1] and CADMAS-SURF/3D [2] to efficiently calculate all stages from tsunami source to runup and to verify their applicability.

abstract = {In the few previous measurements of topographic form drag in the ocean, drag that is much larger than a typical bluff body drag estimate has been consistently found. In this work, theory combined with a numerical model of tidal flow around a headland in a channel gives insight into the mechanisms that create form drag in oscillating flow situations. The total form drag is divided into two parts: the inertial drag, which is derived from a local potential flow solution, and the separation drag, which accounts for flow features such as eddies. The inertial drag can have a large magnitude, yet it cannot do work on the flow because its phase is in quadrature with the velocity. The separation drag has a magnitude that is nearly equal to the bluff body drag and accounts for all of the energy removed from the flow by the topography. In addition, the dependence of the form drag on the tidal excursion distance and the aspect ratio of the headlands were determined with a series of numerical experiments. This theory explains why form drag can be so large in the ocean, and it provides a method for separating the pressure field into the parts that can and cannot extract energy from the flow. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

@article{Madsen1998,
abstract = {Boussinesq-type equations of higher order in dispersion as well as in nonlinearity are derived for waves (and wave-current interaction) over an uneven bottom. Formulations are given in terms of various velocity variables such as the depth-averaged velocity and the particle velocity at the still water level, and at an arbitrary vertical location. The equations are enhanced and analysed with emphasis on linear dispersion, shoaling and nonlinear properties for large wave numbers. As a starting point the velocity potential is expanded as a power series in the vertical coordinate measured from the still water level (SWL). Substituting this expansion into the Laplace equation leads to a velocity field expressed in terms of spatial derivatives of the vertical velocity [w] and the horizontal velocity vector u at the SWL. The series expressions are given to infinite order in the dispersion parameter, {\{}micro{\}}. Satisfying the kinematic bottom boundary condition defines an implicit relation between [w] and u, which is recast as an explicit recursive expression for [w] in terms of u under the assumption that {\{}micro{\}} {\textless}{\textless} 1. Boussinesq equations are then derived from the dynamic and kinematic boundary conditions at the free surface. In this process the infinite series solutions are truncated at O({\{}micro{\}}6), while all orders of the nonlinearity parameter, {\{}epsilon{\}} are included to that order in dispersion. This leads to a set of higher-order Boussinesq equations in terms of the surface elevation {\{}eta{\}} and the horizontal velocity vector u at the SWL. The equations are recast in terms of the depth-averaged velocity, U leaving out O({\{}epsilon{\}}2{\{}micro{\}}4, which corresponds to assuming {\{}epsilon{\}} =O({\{}micro{\}}). This formulation turns out to include singularities in linear dispersion as well as in nonlinearity. Next, the technique introduced by Madsen and others in 1991and Schaffer {\&} Madsen in 1995 is invoked, and this results in aset of enhanced equations formulated in U and including O({\{}micro{\}}4,{\{}epsilon{\}}{\{}micro{\}}4)terms. These equations contain no singularities and the embedded linear and nonlinear properties are shown to be significantly improved. To quantify the accuracy, Stokes's third-order theory is used as reference and Fourier analyses of the new equations are carried out to third order (in nonlinearity) for regular waves on a constant depth and to first order for shoaling characteristics. Furthermore, analyses are carried out to second order for bichromatic waves and to first order for waves in ambient currents. These analyses are not restricted to small values of the linear dispersion parameter, {\{}micro{\}}. In conclusion, the new equations are shown to have linear dispersion characteristics corresponding to a Pade [4,4] expansion in k'h' (wave number times depth) of the squared celerity according to Stokes's linear theory. This corresponds to a quite high accuracy in linear dispersion up to approximately k'h' = 6. The high quality of dispersion is also achieved for the Doppler shift in connection with wave-current interaction and it allows for a study of wave blocking due to opposing currents. Also, the linear shoaling characteristics are shown to be excellent, and the accuracy of nonlinear transfer of energy to sub- and super-harmonics is found to be superior to previous formulations. The equations are then recast in terms of the particle velocity, [u], at an arbitrary vertical location including O{\{}micro{\}}4,{\{}epsilon{\}}5{\{}micro{\}}4)terms. This formulation includes, as special subsets, Boussinesq equations in terms of the bottom velocity or the surface velocity. Furthermore, the arbitrary location of the velocity variable can be used to optimize the embedded linear and nonlinear characteristics. A Fourier analysis is again carried out to third order (in {\{}epsilon{\}}) for regular waves. It turns out that Pade [4,4] linear dispersion characteristics can not be achieved for any choice of the location of the velocity variable. However, for an optimized location we achieve fairly good linear characteristics and very good nonlinear characteristics. Finally, the formulation in terms of [u] is modified by introducing the technique of dispersion enhancement while retaining only O({\{}micro{\}}4,{\{}epsilon{\}}5{\{}micro{\}}4) terms. Now the resulting set of equations do show Pade [4,4] dispersion characteristics in the case of pure waves as well as in connection with ambient currents, and again the nonlinear properties (such as second- and third-order transfer functions and amplitude dispersion) are shown to be superior to those of existing formulations of Boussinesq-type equations.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Ripples are common morphological features in sandy marine environments. Their shapes and dimensions are closely related to local sediment properties and the forcing by waves and currents. Numerous predictors for the geometry and hydraulic roughness of ripples exist but due to their empirical nature, they may fail to properly reflect conditions in the field. Here, situ measurements of ripple dimensions and their dynamics in a shallow shelf sea are reported. Technical and methodological limits of the detection of ripple dimensions and their dynamic evolution due to changing forcing are assessed. Methods of bed detection from sonar data and analysis of ripple dimensions in digital elevation models (DEM) are compared and evaluated. The range of measured ripple dimensions is quantified and compared to results of traditional and recent empirical predictors. The precision of measurements of bedform dimensions is taken as the repeatability of a measurement for inactive conditions and the accuracy of measurement is assessed via comparison to predicted dimensions. The precision of detection is limited to 10 {\%} of the absolute ripple dimensions. The order of magnitude of the ripple dimension can be predicted by the empirical relations. However, these tend to return the height of the largest ripples rather than average heights. The application of different methods for detection of heights may result in derived form roughness heights by up to a factor of two.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This method takes into account the influence of the impingement position of the overflow jet and the influence of harbor-side water depth, both of which are important factors for armor stability. Numerical computation is also carried out aiming at the establishment of a stability analysis method for armor units.

This study uses two strong wind events on Lake Erie to calibrate the drag coefficient using the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Wave Sediment Transport (COAWST) modeling system and the the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). Simulated waves are generated on the lake with Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN). Wind setdown provides the opportunity to eliminate wave setup as a contributing factor, since waves are minimal at the upwind shore. The study finds that model results significantly underestimate wind setdown and storm surge when a typical open-ocean formulation without waves is used for the drag coefficient. The contribution of waves to wind setdown and storm surge is 34.7{\%}. Scattered lake ice also increases the effective drag coefficient by a factor of 1.1.},

This earthquake generated a tsunami that struck Japan as well as various locations around the Pacific Ocean. With the participation of about 300 researchers from throughout Japan, joint research groups conducted a tsunami survey along a 2,000 km stretch of the Japanese coast. More than 5,200 locations have been surveyed to date, generating the largest tsunami survey dataset in the world. The inundation height and run-up height were surveyed by laser, GPS, and other instruments, and the tidal correction has been accurately adjusted using a tidal database and a numerical simulation for Tohoku, an area where tide gauges were destroyed by the tsunami. Based on the survey dataset, the regional and local scale analyses were conducted to understand the basic characteristics of this event. Maximum run-up heights greater than 10 m are distributed along 500 km of coast in direct distance. The affected area of this event was several times larger than historically recorded in Tohoku. The mean inundation height in the southern Sanriku region is 10–15 m and there are several peaks of inundation along the coast from the northern to middle part of Sanriku.},

abstract = {An ability to estimate the large-scale spatial variability of seabed sediment type in the absence of extensive observational data is valuable for many applications. In some physical (e.g., morphodynamic) models, knowledge of seabed sediment type is important for inputting spatially-varying bed roughness, and in biological studies, an ability to estimate the distribution of seabed sediment benefits habitat mapping (e.g., scallop dredging). Although shelf sea sediment motion is complex, driven by a combination of tidal currents, waves, and wind-driven currents, in many tidally energetic seas, such as the Irish Sea, long-term seabed sediment transport is dominated by tidal currents. We compare observations of seabed sediment grain size from 242 Irish Sea seabed samples with simulated tidal-induced bed shear stress from a three-dimensional tidal model (ROMS) to quantitatively define the relationship between observed grain size and simulated bed shear stress. With focus on the median grain size of well-sorted seabed sediment samples, we present predictive maps of the distribution of seabed sediment classes in the Irish Sea, ranging from mud to gravel. When compared with the distribution of well-sorted sediment classifications (mud, sand and gravel) from the British Geological Survey digital seabed sediment map of Irish Sea sediments (DigSBS250), this 'grain size tidal current proxy' (GSTCP) correctly estimates the observed seabed sediment classification in over 73{\%} of the area.},

abstract = {A hierarchy of parametrizations of the neutral 10 m drag coefficients over polar sea ice with different morphology regimes is derived on the basis of a partitioning concept that splits the total surface drag into contributions of skin drag and form drag. The new derivation, which provides drag coefficients as a function of sea ice concentration and characteristic length scales of roughness elements, needs fewer assumptions than previous similar approaches. It is shown that form drag variability can explain the variability of surface drag in the marginal sea ice zone (MIZ) and in the summertime inner Arctic regions. In the MIZ, form drag is generated by floe edges; in the inner Arctic, it is generated by edges at melt ponds and leads due to the elevation of the ice surface relative to the open water surface. It is shown that an earlier fit of observed neutral drag coefficients is obtained as a special case within the new concept when specific simplifications are made which concern the floe and melt pond geometry. Due to the different surface morphologies in the MIZ and summertime Arctic, different functional dependencies of the drag coefficients on the sea ice concentration result. These differences cause only minor differences between the MIZ and summertime drag coefficients in average conditions, but they might be locally important for atmospheric momentum transport to sea ice. The new parametrization formulae can be used for present conditions but also for future climate scenarios with changing sea ice conditions.},

abstract = {Vast areas of wetland occur on shorelines of ponds, lakes, and rivers. These wetlands are divided into vegetation zones, including aquatic vegetation, marsh, and swamp. Here, we provide a simple, mechanistic, and non-equilibrium model that explains the occurrence of marsh as a function of past flood pulses. Marshes are sandwiched between two limits, both of which fluctuate with time. The lower limit is set by the tolerance of marsh plants to continuous flooding. The upper limit is set by competion with woody plants, which are killed by extreme high water events. The twin limit marsh model (TLMM) requires long-term water-level records and two biological inputs: duration of flooding required to drown marsh plants (f) and the duration of dewatering required for woody plants to reinvade once water levels drop (s). In the temperate zone, we suggest that f is {\~{}}4 yr and s is {\~{}}30 yr. We illustrate the model for the marshes of Lakes Erie and Ontario. High water years that kill woody plants, followed by low water years, produce large expanses of marsh. The regulation of lakes and rivers generally has negative effects on marsh area and diversity. The TLMM can be calibrated for other climates or ecoregions.},

abstract = {Coastal areas epitomize the notion of ‘at-risk' territory in the context of climate change and sea level rise (SLR). Knowledge of the water level changes at the coast resulting from the mean sea level variability, tide, atmospheric surge and wave setup is critical for coastal flooding assessment. This study investigates how coastal water level can be altered by interactions between SLR, tides, storm surges, waves and flooding. The main mechanisms of interaction are identified, mainly by analyzing the shallow water equations. Based on a literature review, the orders of magnitude of these interactions are estimated in different environments. The investigated interactions exhibit a strong spatiotemporal variability. Depending on the type of environments (e.g., morphology, hydrometeorological context), they can reach several tens of centimeters (positive or negative). As a consequence, probabilistic projections of future coastal water levels and flooding should identify whether interaction processes are of leading order, and, where appropriate, projections should account for these interactions through modeling or statistical methods.},

The propagation of long period waves over large distances for different shapes is studied experimentally and numerically. Fully nonlinear potential flow theory has been used to model these cases numerically along with Korteweg–de Vries simulations. The theoretical explanation of the observed effects has been discussed. The run-up characteristics of the studied waves with respect to their shape and beach slope were also investigated. Further, a downscaled real tsunami time series is also reproduced experimentally and studied with regard to its possible run-up.},

abstract = {Changes in the sea-level annual cycle (SLAC) can have profound impacts on coastal areas, including increased flooding risk and ecosystem alteration, yet little is known about the magnitude and drivers of such changes. Here we show, using novel Bayesian methods, that there are significant decadal fluctuations in the amplitude of the SLAC along the United States Gulf and Southeast coasts, including an extreme event in 2008–2009 that is likely (probability ≥68{\%}) unprecedented in the tide-gauge record. Such fluctuations are coherent along the coast but decoupled from deep-ocean changes. Through the use of numerical and analytical ocean models, we show that the primary driver of these fluctuations involves incident Rossby waves that generate fast western-boundary waves. These Rossby waves project onto the basin-wide upper mid-ocean transport (top 1000 m) leading to a link with the SLAC, wherein larger SLAC amplitudes coincide with enhanced transport variability.},

abstract = {This paper explores simulated changes to the cool-season (November-March) storm-surge and coastal-flooding events at the Battery in New York City, New York (NYC), during most of the twenty-first century using several climate models and a previously developed multilinear regression model. The surface wind and pressure forcing for the surge predictions are obtained from an ensemble of 6 coupled global climate models (GCM) and 30 members from the Community Earth System Model. Using the "RCP8.5" emission scenario, both the single-model and multimodel ensemble means yielded insignificant (significance level p {\textgreater} 0.05) simulated changes to the median surge event ({\textgreater}0.61 m above astronomical tide) between a historical period (1979-2004) and the mid-to-late twenty-first century (2054-79). There is also little change in the return interval for the moderate-to-high surge events. By the mid-to-late twenty-first century, there is a poleward shift of the mean surface cyclone track in many of the models and most GCMs demonstrate an intensification of the average cyclone. There is little effect on the future surge events at the Battery because most of these storm changes are not in a region that favors more or higher-amplitude surges at NYC. Rather, projected sea level rise dominates the future simulated change in the number of flooding events by the mid-to-late twenty-first century. For example, the projections show about 23 times as many coastal-flooding events (tide + surge ≥ 2.44 m above mean lower low water; 1983-2001) in 2079 when compared with 1979, and the return intervals for some major coastal floods (e.g., the December 1992 northeaster) decrease by a factor of 3-4.},

The methods are based on the conformal properties of stereographic and Mercator map projections and have been developed with the specific object of removing the North Pole from the ocean domain. Some of the configurations, in addition to overcoming the pole problem, have very attractive resolution properties in the polar regions. Two of the constructions are geometrical in nature, while a third is based on the superposition of potential fields generated by discrete coordinate poles. The methods described here differ from those commonly employed in engineering problems in that grid line control is exercised by the placement of a finite number of singularities, and no specific condition is placed upon the fitting of coordinate lines to physical boundaries. The grids produced are accordingly of global construction and have smooth variations in grid size. Being of analytical or semi-analytical formulation, the grids may be generated quickly and without the need for advanced software. {\textcopyright} 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

Using this internal wave-maker method, various numerical experiments have been conducted without any problems due to waves reflected by a wave-maker. In this study, an internal wave-maker method using a momentum source function was proposed. Various numerical simulations in two and three dimensions were performed using the momentum source wave-maker applied to the RANS equation model in a CFD code, FLUENT. To verify their applicability in 2 dimensions, the computational results obtained using the momentum source wave-maker in a channel of constant depth were compared with the results obtained by using the mass source wave-maker and with the analytical solutions. And the results of the present numerical simulations of hydraulic experiments, which represent nonlinear waves on a submerged shoal and breaking waves on a plane beach, were compared with measurements. The comparisons showed good agreements between them. To see their applicability into 3-dimensional cases, the present results in a basin of constant depth were compared with the analytical solutions, and they agreed well with each other. In addition, vertical variation of longshore current was presented by using the 3-dimensional simulation results.},

abstract = {This project aimed to develop a new high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and adjoining Coral Sea at a grid pixel resolution of 0.001-arc degree (about 100 m). A high-resolution DEM is a critical 3D dataset required to accurately simulate water mixing and current flow within a whole-of-GBR scale hydrodynamic model. In addition, a new grid is required to improve the geomorphic detail about the location and spatial extent of seabed features for much of the GBR shelf and Coral Sea region. The new grid utilised the latest data sourced from ship-based multibeam and singlebeam echosounder surveys, airborne lidar bathymetry surveys, and satellite data. This report contains an explanation of the various source datasets used in the development of the new grid, and how the data were treated in order to convert to a similar file format with common horizontal (WGS84) and vertical (Mean Sea Level) datums. Descriptive statistics are presented to show the relative proportion of source data used in the new grid. The report continues with a detailed explanation of the pre-processing and gridding process methodology used to develop the grid. A description is also provided for additional spatial analysis on the new grid in order to derive associated grids and layers. The results section provides a short overview of the improvement of the new grid over the current Australian Bathymetry and Topography Grid. The report then presents the results of the new grid, called gbr100, and the associated derived map outputs as a series of figures.

abstract = {OASIS is coupling software developed primarily for use in the climate community. It provides the ability to couple different models with low implementation and performance overhead. OASIS3-MCT is the latest version of OASIS. It includes several improvements compared to OASIS3, including elimination of a separate hub coupler process, parallelization of the coupling communication and run-time grid interpolation, and the ability to easily reuse mapping weight files. OASIS3-MCT-3.0 is the latest release and includes the ability to couple between components running sequentially on the same set of tasks as well as to couple within a single component between different grids or decompositions such as physics, dynamics, and I/O. OASIS3-MCT has been tested with different configurations on up to 32 000 processes, with components running on high-resolution grids with up to 1.5 million grid cells, and with over 10ĝ€000 2-D coupling fields. Several new features will be available in OASIS3-MCT-4.0, and some of those are also described.},

abstract = {The 120 m sea-level drop during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 18–22 kyr BP) had a profound impact on the global tides and lead to an increased tidal dissipation rate, especially in the North Atlantic. Here, we present new simulations of the evolution of the global tides from the LGM to present for the dominating diurnal and semidiurnal constituents. The simulations are undertaken in time slices spanning 500–1000 years. Due to uncertainties in the location of the grounding line of the Antarctic ice sheets during the last glacial, simulations are carried out for two different grounding line scenarios. Our results replicate previously reported enhancements in dissipation and amplitudes of the semidiurnal tide during LGM and subsequent deglaciation, and they provide a detailed picture of the large global changes in M2 tidal dynamics occurring over the deglaciation period. We show that Antarctic ice dynamics and the associated grounding line location have a large influence on global semidiurnal tides, whereas the diurnal tides mainly experience regional changes and are not impacted by grounding line shifts in Antarctica.},

abstract = {Historical reanalyses that span more than a century are needed for a wide range of studies, from understanding large-scale climate trends to diagnosing the impacts of individual historical extreme weather events. The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) Project is an effort to fill this need. It is supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and is facilitated by collaboration with the international Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth initiative. 20CR is the first ensemble of sub-daily global atmospheric conditions spanning over 100 years. This provides a best estimate of the weather at any given place and time as well as an estimate of its confidence and uncertainty. While extremely useful, version 2c of this dataset (20CRv2c) has several significant issues, including inaccurate estimates of confidence and a global sea level pressure bias in the mid-19th century. These and other issues can reduce its effectiveness for studies at many spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, the 20CR system underwent a series of developments to generate a significant new version of the reanalysis. The version 3 system (NOAA-CIRES-DOE 20CRv3) uses upgraded data assimilation methods including an adaptive inflation algorithm; has a newer, higher-resolution forecast model that specifies dry air mass; and assimilates a larger set of pressure observations. These changes have improved the ensemble-based estimates of confidence, removed spin-up effects in the precipitation fields, and diminished the sea-level pressure bias. Other improvements include more accurate representations of storm intensity, smaller errors, and large-scale reductions in model bias. The 20CRv3 system is comprehensively reviewed, focusing on the aspects that have ameliorated issues in 20CRv2c. Despite the many improvements, some challenges remain, including a systematic bias in tropical precipitation and time-varying biases in southern high-latitude pressure fields.},

abstract = {Sea-level rise due to both climate change and non-climatic factors threatens coastal settle- ments, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Projections of mean global sea-level (GSL) rise provide insufficient information to plan adaptive responses; local decisions require local projections that accommodate dif- ferent risk tolerances and time frames and that can be linked to storm surge projections. Here we present a global set of local sea-level (LSL) projections to inform decisions on timescales ranging fromthe com- ing decades through the 22nd century.We provide complete probability distributions, informed by a combination of expert community assessment, expert elicitation, and process modeling. Between the years 2000 and 2100, we project a very likely (90{\%} probability) GSL rise of 0.5–1.2munder representa- tive concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5, 0.4–0.9munder RCP 4.5, and 0.3–0.8munder RCP 2.6. Site-to-site differences in LSL projections are due to varying non-climatic background uplift or subsidence, oceano- graphic effects, and spatially variable responses of the geoid and the lithosphere to shrinking land ice. The Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) constitutes a growing share of variance in GSL and LSL projections. In the global average and at many locations, it is the dominant source of variance in late 21st century projections, though at some sites oceanographic processes contribute the largest share throughout the century. LSL rise dramatically reshapes flood risk, greatly increasing the expected number of “1-in-10” and “1-in-100” year events.},

These models present challenges stemming from their interdisciplinary nature and from their computational and algorithmic complexities. The computational complexity of individual models, combined with the popularity of the distributed-memory parallel programming model used on commodity microprocessor-based clusters, results in a parallel coupling problem when building a coupled model. We define and elucidate this problem and how it results in a set of requirements for software capable of simplifying the construction of parallel coupled models. We describe the package, the Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT), which we have developed to meet these general requirements and the specific requirements of a parallel climate model. We present the MCT programming model with illustrative code examples. We present representative results that measure MCT's scalability, performance portability, and a proxy for coupling overhead. {\textcopyright} 2005 Sage Publications.},

abstract = {Tropical cyclones (TC) are one of the deadliest and costliest natural disasters. To mitigate the impact of such disasters, it is essential to know extreme exceedance probabilities, also known as return periods, of TC hazards. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of the STORM dataset, containing synthetic TCs equivalent of 10,000 years under present-day climate conditions, for the calculation of TC wind speed return periods. The temporal length of the STORM dataset allows us to empirically calculate return periods up to 10,000 years without fitting an extreme value distribution. We show that fitting a distribution typically results in higher wind speeds compared to their empirically derived counterparts, especially for return periods exceeding 100-yr. By applying a parametric wind model to the TC tracks, we derive return periods at 10 km resolution in TC-prone regions. The return periods are validated against observations and previous studies, and show a good agreement. The accompanying global-scale wind speed return period dataset is publicly available and can be used for high-resolution TC risk assessments.},

abstract = {In this paper, a numerical two-phase flow model for incompressible viscous fluid is presented for the simulation of wave propagation in shallow water, including the processes of wave shoaling, wave breaking, wave reflection and air movement. The model consists of the continuity equation, the Navier–Stokes equations, the fractional VOF function equation, and the equations of density and viscosity. The turbulent eddy viscosity is evaluated by using the Smagorinsky's sub-grid scale model. The VOF method with an advection algorithm following [Int. J. Numer Meth. Fluids 35 (2001) 151] is employed for tracking the free surface. To solve the time evolution of the governing equations, the SMAC method and iteration technique are used. The convective terms in the momentum equation are approximated using a high accuracy CIP scheme proposed in [Comput. Phys. Commun. 66 (1991) 219]. A numerical test with dam break problem was conducted and compared with experimental data to verify the validity and stability of the model. The model was then applied to simulate the wave breaking on a sloping bottom and the numerical results were compared with experimental data. The results demonstrated that the present model is capable of simulating wave deformation in shallow water, as well as wave breaking problem.},

abstract = {The coupled ocean-atmosphere-wave-sediment transport (COAWST) modeling system was used to investigate atmosphere-ocean-wave interactions in November 2009 during Hurricane Ida and its subsequent evolution to Nor'Ida, which was one of the most costly storm systems of the past two decades. One interesting aspect of this event is that it included two unique atmospheric extreme conditions, a hurricane and a nor'easter storm, which developed in regions with different oceanographic characteristics. Our modeled results were compared with several data sources, including GOES satellite infrared data, JASON-1 and JASON-2 altimeter data, CODAR measurements, and wave and tidal information from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and the National Tidal Database. By performing a series of numerical runs, we were able to isolate the effect of the interaction terms between the atmosphere (modeled with Weather Research and Forecasting, the WRF model), the ocean (modeled with Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS)), and the wave propagation and generation model (modeled with Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN)). Special attention was given to the role of the ocean surface roughness. Three different ocean roughness closure models were analyzed: DGHQ (which is based on wave age), TY2001 (which is based on wave steepness), and OOST (which considers both the effects of wave age and steepness). Including the ocean roughness in the atmospheric module improved the wind intensity estimation and therefore also the wind waves, surface currents, and storm surge amplitude. For example, during the passage of Hurricane Ida through the Gulf of Mexico, the wind speeds were reduced due to wave-induced ocean roughness, resulting in better agreement with the measured winds. During Nor'Ida, including the wave-induced surface roughness changed the form and dimension of the main low pressure cell, affecting the intensity and direction of the winds. The combined wave age- and wave steepness-based parameterization (OOST) provided the best results for wind and wave growth prediction. However, the best agreement between the measured (CODAR) and computed surface currents and storm surge values was obtained with the wave steepness-based roughness parameterization (TY2001), although the differences obtained with respect to DGHQ were not significant. The influence of sea surface temperature (SST) fields on the atmospheric boundary layer dynamics was examined; in particular, we evaluated how the SST affects wind wave generation, surface currents and storm surges. The integrated hydrograph and integrated wave height, parameters that are highly correlated with the storm damage potential, were found to be highly sensitive to the ocean surface roughness parameterization. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Storm-induced coastal flooding is among the most destructive natural disasters, as seen recently in the Bay of Bengal, the Gulf of Mexico and the Philippines. This study presents a high resolution hindcast of the flooding associated with Xynthia, a mid-latitude storm that severely hit the central part of the Bay of Biscay in February 2010. A 2DH fully coupled modeling systemis applied to the North-East Atlantic Ocean, with a resolution locally reaching a few meters along the coastline of the study area. Such a fine resolution was required to adequately represent the dikes and the barriers that usually prevent the area from flooding, but results in a {\textgreater}1,700,000 element unstructured grid. The comparison with the available data reveals that waves and water levels are reproduced with normalized errors of the order of 10{\%} and 5{\%}, respectively. The extension of the flooding is also well reproduced, although with some underestimations along the coastline and overestimation in the inner part of large marshes. These limitations are explained by a lack of spatial resolution locally and the absence of several processes in the model such as infragravity waves and wave runup. The comparison between our baseline simulation and a simulation where the flooding is disabled by increasing the dike height reveals differences in maximum water levels locally reaching 1.0 m. This result is of key importance for coastal management strategies and also questions classical engineering approaches relying on one-way nesting.},

In MIROC3m, the horizontal resolution is 2.8125◦ for the atmospheric Compared with MIROC3h and MIROC3m, many improvements have been achieved; for example, errors in the sur- face air temperature and sea surface temperature are smaller, there is less drift of the ocean water temperature in the subsurface-deep ocean, and the frequency of heavy rain is comparable to observations. The fine horizontal resolution in the atmosphere makes orographic wind and its effects on the ocean more realistic than those of the former models, and the treatment of coastal upwelling motion in the ocean has been improved. Phenomena in the atmosphere and ocean related to the El Ni˜no and southern oscillation are now closer to observations than was obtained by MIROC3h and MIROC3m. The effective climate sensitivity for CO2 doubling is calculated to be about 5.7 K, which is much larger than the value obtained using the IPCC AR4 models, and is mainly due to a decrease in the low-level clouds at low latitudes.},

abstract = {This is the second part of a two-part investigation of a coupled wind and wave model that includes the enhanced form drag of breaking waves. The model is based on the wave energy balance and the conservation of air-side momentum and energy. In Part I, coupled nonlinear advance-delay differential equations were derived, which govern the wave height spectrum, the distribution of breaking waves, and vertical air side profiles of the turbulent stress and wind speed. Numeric solutions were determined for mature seas. Here, numeric solutions for a wide range of wind and wave conditions are obtained, including young, strongly forced wind waves. Furthermore, the "spatial sheltering effect" is introduced so that smaller waves in airflow separation regions of breaking longer waves cannot be forced by the wind. The solutions strongly depend on the wave height curvature spectrum at high wavenumbers (the "threshold saturation level"). As the threshold saturation level is reduced, the effect of breaking waves becomes stronger. For young strongly forced waves (laboratory conditions), breaking waves close to the spectral peak dominate the wind input and previous solutions of a model with only input to breaking waves are recovered. Model results of the normalized roughness length are generally consistent with previous laboratory and field measurements. For field conditions, the wind stress depends sensitively on the wave height spectrum. The spatial sheltering may modify the number of breaking shorter waves, in particular, for younger seas. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {A two-phase flow CFD model based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations coupled with the level set method (LSM) and k−$\omega$ turbulence model is used to simulate spilling breakers over a sloping bed. In order to validate the present numerical model, the simulated results are compared with the experimental data measured by Ting and Kirby (1996). The simulated horizontal velocities and free surface elevations are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. Moreover, the present model is able to model the prominent features associated with the breaking process such as the motion of air pockets in the water, formation of a forward moving jet, the splash-up phenomenon and the mixing of air and water in the breaking region. The numerical model has been utilized to study the influences of three important environmental parameters; water depth, offshore wave steepness and beach slope on the characteristics and geometric properties of spilling breakers over slopes. A total of 39 numerical experiment cases are performed to investigate the characteristics of breaking waves such as breaking location, incipient breaker height and water depth at breaking, incipient breaker indices and geometric properties with different offshore wave steepnesses at different water depths over a wide range of beach slopes. The geometric properties associated with breaking waves in shallow water are described using the wave steepness and asymmetry factors introduced by Kjeldsen and Myrhaug (1978). The computed results appear to give reasonable predictions and consistency with previous studies.},

abstract = {New versions of the high-resolution 20- and 60-km-mesh Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) atmospheric general circulation models (MRI-AGCM version 3.2) have been developed and used to investigate potential future changes in tropical cyclone (TC) activity. Compared with the previous version (version 3.1), version 3.2 yields a more realistic simulation of the present-day (1979-2003) global distribution of TCs. Moreover, the 20-km-mesh model version 3.2 is able to simulate extremely intense TCs (categories 4 and 5), which is the first time a global climate model has been able to simulate such extremely intense TCs through amultidecadal simulation. Future (2075-99) projections under the Intergovernmental Panel onClimateChange (IPCC) A1B scenario are conducted using versions 3.1 and 3.2, showing consistent decreases in the number of TCs globally and in both hemispheres as climate warms. Although projected future changes in basin-scale TC numbers show some differences between the two versions, the projected frequency of TC occurrence shows a consistent decrease in the western part of the western North Pacific (WNP) and in the South Pacific Ocean (SPO), while it shows a marked increase in the central Pacific. Both versions project a future increase in the frequency of intense TCs globally; however, the degree of increase is smaller in version 3.2 than in version 3.1. This difference arises partly because version 3.2 projects a pronounced decrease in mean TC intensity in the SPO. The 20-km-mesh model version 3.2 projects a northward shift in the most intense TCs (category 5) in the WNP, indicating an increasing potential for future catastrophic damage due to TCs in this region. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

These storms, sometimes called megastorms or superstorms, were the first in which high-resolution satellite imagery was available in the immediate aftermath, providing a new tool for rapidly evaluating damage to archaeological sites. Using Hurricane Harvey as a case study, we examined two recent spatial models of archaeological site vulnerability to long-term climate change to determine whether these models are also adequate for predicting the impacts of short-term climate catastrophes. We further examined a number of individual variables that we expected to be useful in predicting which sites would be most vulnerable to flooding, such as proximity to rivers, the coast, or the floodplain. Neither the models nor the individual variables correlated well to increased risk to archaeological sites, with the exception of land use. Sites located within developed areas benefited from measures to protect property and were less often flooded. We suggest that strategies for responding to megastorms would be most effective through a combination of preparedness, analysis of remote sensing data, and existing field research methods.},

abstract = {How and where the ocean tides dissipate their energy are longstanding questions that have consequences ranging from the history of the Moon to the mixing of the oceans. Historically, the principal sink of tidal energy has been thought to be bottom friction in shallow seas. There has long been suggestive however, that tidal dissipation also occurs in the open ocean through the scattering by ocean-bottom topography of surface tides into internal waves, but estimates of the magnitude of this possible sink have varied widely. Here we use satellite altimeter data from Topex/Poseidon to map empirically the tidal energy dissipation. We show that approximately 10(exp 12) watts-that is, 1 TW, representing 25-30{\%} of the total dissipation-occurs in the deep ocean, generally near areas of rough topography. Of the estimated 2 TW of mixing energy required to maintain the large-scale thermohaline circulation of the ocean, one-half could therefore be provided by the tides, with the other half coming from action on the surface of the ocean.},

Subject to uncertainties in the river flows, atmospheric forcing, initial condition of salinity and temperature, and digital elevation model of bathymetry-topography, the model is shown to generally exhibit good skills for predicting inundation and compound surges, with a hit rate for inundation extent of 0.92, average mean-absolute-errors of 0.65 m for HWMs, 1.7 psu for salinity, and 1.4 °C for temperature. We then apply the model to quantify the individual contributions from the three major forcings (ocean, river and precipitation). Comparison of results (in the form of ‘compound ratio') from the simulations with three factors being applied individually with those from the baseline simulation with all factors included in a single model reveals the nonlinear compounding effects in most of the areas in Galveston Bay, and indicates that the compound flooding problems are best simulated using a single model that integrates across all factors because the interactions among processes are very complex and highly nonlinear; in other words, summing up the results from individual forcings would lead to large errors. For example, the hydrodynamic model results forced by river inflows at boundary and oceanic and atmospheric forcings, without explicitly accounting for the direct precipitation in the coastal watersheds, would severely underestimate the resultant flow and surge by up to 90{\%}. ‘Regions of dominance' are also identified for each forcing factor from the sensitivity results. These concepts are applicable to other compound flooding studies as well.},

abstract = {This article investigates combining a WRF-ADCIRC ensemble with track clustering to evaluate how uncertainties in tropical cyclone–induced storm tide (surge + tide) predictions vary in space and time and to explore whether this method can help elucidate inundation hazard scenarios. The method is demonstrated for simulations of Hurricane Irma (2017) initialized at 1200 UTC 5 September, approximately 5 days before Irma's Florida landfalls, and 1200 UTC 8 September. Mixture models are used to partition the WRF ensemble tracks from 5 and 8 September into six and five clusters, respectively. Inundation is evaluated in two affected regions: southwest (south and west Florida) and northeast (northeast Florida through South Carolina). For the 5 September simulations, inundation in the southwest region varies significantly across the ensemble, indicating low forecast confidence. However, clustering highlights the areas of inundation risk in south and west Florida associated with different storm tracks. In the northeast region, every cluster has high inundation probabilities along a similar coastal stretch, indicating high confidence at a {\~{}}5-day lead time that this area will experience inundation. For the 8 September simulations, track and inundation in both regions vary less across the ensemble, but clustering remains useful for distinguishing among flooding scenarios. These results demonstrate the potential of dynamical TC–surge ensembles to illuminate important aspects of storm surge risk, including highlighting regions of high forecast confidence where preparations can reliably be initiated early. The analysis also shows how clustering can augment probabilistic hazard forecasts by elucidating inundation scenarios and variability across a surge ensemble.},

These forcing terms require global integrations of the tidal elevations, turning the dynamical differential equations into integro‐differential equations. Following Accad and Pekeris, many authors approximate the self‐attraction/loading terms by a simple scalar multiplier of the local tidal elevation, but the choice of multiplier is not obvious and is often confused. The one recommended by Accad and Pekeris generates large errors in the open ocean. Other scaling factors are examined here; none is recommended in general, and most serious applications should use the full integral formulation. New estimates of the self‐attraction/loading fields, based on global tidal measurements from recent satellite altimeters, are now readily available.},

The model solves the Reynolds eq{\'{u}}ations for the mean (ensemble average) flow field and the k-$\epsilon$ equations for the turbulent kinetic energy, k, and the turbulence dissipation rate, $\epsilon$. A nonlinear Reynolds stress model (Shih, Zhu {\&} Lumley 1996) is employed to relate the Reynolds stresses and the strain rates of the mean flow. To track free-surface movements, the volume of fluid (VOF) method is employed. To ensure the accuracy of each component of the numerical model, several steps have been taken to verify numerical solutions with either analytical solutions or experimental data. For non-breaking waves, very accurate results are obtained for a solitary wave propagating over a long distance in a constant depth. Good agreement between numerical results and experimental data has also been observed for shoaling and breaking cnoidal waves on a sloping beach in terms of free-surface profiles, mean velocities, and turbulent kinetic energy. Based on the numerical results, turbulence transport mechanisms under breaking waves are discussed.},

abstract = {This study is focused on the integration of bare earth lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) data into unstructured (triangular) finite element meshes and the implications on simulating storm surge inundation using a shallow water equations model. A methodology is developed to compute root mean square error (RMSE) and the 95th percentile of vertical elevation errors using four different interpolation methods (linear, inverse distance weighted, natural neighbor, and cell averaging) to resample bare earth lidar and lidar-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) onto unstructured meshes at different resolutions. The results are consolidated into a table of optimal interpolation methods that minimize the vertical elevation error of an unstructured mesh for a given mesh node density. The cell area averaging method performed most accurate when DEM grid cells within 0.25 times the ratio of local element size and DEM cell size were averaged. The methodology is applied to simulate inundation extent and maximum water levels in southern Mississippi due to Hurricane Katrina, which illustrates that local changes in topography such as adjusting element size and interpolation method drastically alter simulated storm surge locally and non-locally. The methods and results presented have utility and implications to any modeling application that uses bare earth lidar. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Ocean tides are the main source of high-frequency variability in the vertical and horizontal motion of ice sheets near their marine margins. Floating ice shelves, which occupy about three quarters of the perimeter of Antarctica and the termini of four outlet glaciers in northern Greenland, rise and fall in synchrony with the ocean tide. Lateral motion of floating and grounded portions of ice sheets near their marine margins can also include a tidal component. These tide-induced signals provide insight into the processes by which the oceans can affect ice sheet mass balance and dynamics. In this review, we summarize in situ and satellite-based measurements of the tidal response of ice shelves and grounded ice, and spatial variability of ocean tide heights and currents around the ice sheets. We review sensitivity of tide heights and currents as ocean geometry responds to variations in sea level, ice shelf thickness, and ice sheet mass and extent. We then describe coupled ice-ocean models and analytical glacier models that quantify the effect of ocean tides on lower-frequency ice sheet mass loss and motion. We suggest new observations and model developments to improve the representation of tides in coupled models that are used to predict future ice sheet mass loss and the associated contribution to sea level change. The most critical need is for new data to improve maps of bathymetry, ice shelf draft, spatial variability of the drag coefficient at the ice-ocean interface, and higher-resolution models with improved representation of tidal energy sinks.},

MCT was created to address the challenges of creating a parallel coupler for the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). Each of the submodels that make up CCSM is a separate parallel application with its own domain decomposition, running on its own set of processors. This application contains multiple instances of the M × N problem, the problem of transferring data between two parallel programs running on disjoint sets of processors. CCSM also requires efficient data transfer to facilitate its interpolation algorithms. MCT was created as a generalized solution to handle these and other common functions in parallel coupled models. Here we describe MCT's implementation of the data transfer infrastructure needed for a parallel coupled model. The performance of MCT scales satisfactorily as processors are added to the system. However, the types of decompositions used in the submodels can affect performance. MCT's infrastructure provides a flexible and high-performing set of tools for enabling interoperability between parallel applications. {\textcopyright} 2005 Sage Publications.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this paper we present the Oceanographic Multipurpose Software Environment (OMUSE). This framework aims to provide a homogeneous environment for existing or newly developed numerical ocean simulation codes, simplifying their use and deployment. In this way, OMUSE facilitates the design of numerical experiments that combine ocean models representing different physics or spanning different ranges of physical scales. Rapid development of simulation models is made possible through the creation of simple high-level scripts, with the low-level core part of the abstraction designed to deploy these simulations efficiently on heterogeneous high performance computing resources. Cross-verification of simulation models with different codes and numerical methods is facilitated by the unified interface that OMUSE provides. Reproducibility in numerical experiments is fostered by allowing complex numerical experiments to be expressed in portable scripts that conform to a common OMUSE interface. Here, we present the design of OMUSE as well as the modules and model components currently included, which range from a simple conceptual quasi-geostrophic solver, to the global circulation model POP. We discuss the types of the couplings that can be implemented using OMUSE and present example applications, that demonstrate the efficient and relatively straightforward model initialisation and coupling within OMUSE. These also include the concurrent use of data analysis tools on a running model. We also give examples of multi-scale and multi-physics simulations by embedding a regional ocean model into a global ocean model, and in coupling a surface wave propagation model with a coastal circulation model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of a new large scale laboratory data set on the kinematics of breaking tsunami wavefronts. The aim of the experiments was to provide an open access data set for model testing, calibration and verification, with particular emphasis on fluid kinematics in the wave breaking and run-up (swash) zones. The experiments were performed over a composite slope in the tsunami wave basin at the O. H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory at Oregon State University. Data for ten different wave conditions were collected, including non-breaking and breaking waves, and both shore breaks and fully developed long bores. Surface elevation and fluid kinematics were measured with a closely spaced array of surface piercing wave gauges, non-contact ultrasonic wave gauges and four 3-D side-looking Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters. The array was traversed from the nearshore (depth=0.2 m) to the middle and upper run-up zone, providing kinematic data at 30 cross-shore locations. Video was also recorded from 4 cameras covering the propagation, breaking and run-up zones. Surface elevation, flow velocities and the wave maker displacement were also recorded to provide offshore boundary conditions. The experiments include conditions with wave heights up to 0.55 m, notional wave periods up to 20 s and run-up lengths of up to 15.2 m on a 1/30 slope. In terms of the slope in the shoaling and breaker zones, the data correspond to Iribarren numbers in the range of 0.26–5.6. Raw, calibrated and processed data are stored with open access within the OSU Tsunami Wave Basin Experiment Notebook, which provides full access to all the wave maker control signals, data, instrument coordinates, and processing and plotting software. This paper serves as an introduction to the data set, demonstrates data quality and provides an initial analysis of some key parameters that govern the impact of tsunami events, including run-up versus offshore wave conditions and nearshore bore height, the maximum inundation depths at the original shoreline position, and the time to maximum inundation depth and flow reversal. Examples of temporal and convective accelerations and turbulent flow components are also presented to illustrate further details of the kinematics.},

abstract = {Two modifications to an existing scheme of tidal mixing are implemented in the coarse resolution ocean component of a global climate model. First, the vertical distribution of energy flux out of the barotropic tide is determined using high resolution bathymetry. This shifts the levels of mixing higher up in the water column and leads to a stronger mid-depth meridional overturning circulation in the model. Second, the local dissipation efficiency for diurnal tides is assumed to be larger than that for the semi-diurnal tides poleward of 30°. Both modifications are shown to improve agreement with observational estimates of diapycnal diffusivities based on microstructure measurements and circulation indices. We also assess impacts of different spatial distributions of the barotropic energy loss. Estimates based on satellite altimetry lead to larger diffusivities in the deep ocean and hence a stronger deep overturning circulation in our climate model that is in better agreement with observation based estimates compared to those based on a tidal model.},

abstract = {In 1960, R.E. Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers {\&} results.},

abstract = {Over the last couple of decades both the qualitative and quantitative understanding of breaking waves in the surf zone have greatly increased. This is due to the advances in experimental and numerical techniques. However, few comparisons between these two different investigative techniques for surf-zone breaking waves have been reported. In this study, a comparison is made between the experimental and numerical investigation of the internal kinematics of a surf-zone plunging breaker. The full-field velocity measuring technique known as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is used in the experiments. In the hybrid numerical scheme, the main model solves the Navier–Stokes equations using a Finite Volume method and the free-surface is simulated using a Volume of Fluid (VOF) method. An important feature of this work is that, unlike in most other comparisons between numerical and experimental results, the exact geometry of the physical wave flume and the exact motion of the physical wavemaker are duplicated in the numerical wave tank. To achieve this, an additional numerical model using a Boundary-Integral Method (BIM) is employed to generate the input conditions for the Navier–Stokes solver. Very good agreement was found for all comparisons: free-surface elevations, velocity vector maps, velocity profiles and velocity-magnitude contours. However, some small discrepancies were observed. In the free-surface elevation comparisons, a slight time lag was observed in the numerical results and it is suggested that this was due to the small amount of smoothing applied in the BIM to enable it to continue to supply input data to the Navier–Stokes solver well beyond the breaking of the wave. In addition, some small differences were also found between the numerically predicted velocity distributions and those measured in the experiments. These disagreements occurred mostly in the aerated region and it is proposed that they could be caused by errors in the PIV velocity data due to air bubble effects. However, they could also be attributed to the fact that no turbulence model is used in the numerical scheme and it is these aerated areas where the turbulence levels are the highest.},

abstract = {Dissipation of tidal energy causes the Moon to recede from the Earth. The currently measured rate of recession implies that the age of the Lunar orbit is 1500 My old, but the Moon is known to be 4500 My old. Consequently, it has been proposed that tidal energy dissipation was weaker in the Earth's past, but explicit numerical calculations are missing for such long time intervals. Here, for the first time, numerical tidal model simulations linked to climate model output are conducted for a range of paleogeographic configurations over the last 252 My. We find that the present is a poor guide to the past in terms of tidal dissipation: the total dissipation rates for most of the past 252 My were far below present levels. This allows us to quantify the reduced tidal dissipation rates over the most resent fraction of lunar history, and the lower dissipation allows refinement of orbitally-derived age models by inserting a complete additional precession cycle.},

The finest resolution (TL959) showed the highest skills in terms of TC intensity and interannual and seasonal variations in TC genesis number. Resolutions of TL319 (60-km mesh) and finer showed a significant future increase in the frequency of intense TCs, whereas resolutions coarser than TL319 showed no such change, indicating that TL319 is the critical resolution in projecting future change in the frequency of intense TCs. Overall, high model resolution is preferable for realistic and reliable climate projections. Resolutions of TL159 (120-km mesh) and finer showed similar skills, biases, and future changes in the spatial pattern of TC genesis frequency (TGF) and TC genesis number, indicating the potential use of lower model resolutions for minimizing uncertainties in future changes in the mean state of TGF and TC genesis number. {\textcopyright} 2010, the Meteorological Society of Japan.},

abstract = {A high-resolution coupled ocean-wave-atmosphere model (Uppsala University Coupled model, UU-CM) of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea with improved representation of ocean-wave-atmosphere interaction processes is presented. In the UU-CM model, the stress on the air-sea interface is estimated as a balance of four stress terms, that is, the air-side stress, ocean-side stress, wave-supported stress (absorption of momentum by the wave field), and the momentum flux from waves to currents (breaking waves). The vector differences between these four stress terms are considered in the coupled system. The turbulent kinetic energy flux induced by wave breaking, the Stokes-Coriolis force and the Stokes drift material advection terms are added to the ocean circulation model component. Based on two-month-long (January and July) simulations, we find that the ocean-wave-atmosphere coupling has a significant influence on coastal areas. The coupled system captures the influence of surface currents and local systems such as coastal upwelling and their impact on the atmosphere. The wave-current interaction enhances the upper ocean mixing and reduces the sea surface temperature in July significantly. However, the pattern of the wave-current processes influences on the ocean current and waves are complex due to the stress differences in both magnitude and direction.},

@article{Madsen2010,
abstract = {In the literature it has so far been common practice to consider solitary waves and N-waves (composed of solitary waves) as the appropriate model of tsunamis approaching the shoreline. Unfortunately, this approach is based on a tie between the nonlinearity and the horizontal length scale (or duration) of the wave, which is not realistic for geophysical tsunamis. To resolve this problem, we first derive analytical solutions to the nonlinear shallow-water (NSW) equations for the runup/rundown of single waves, where the duration and the wave height can be specified separately. The formulation is then extended to cover leading depression N-waves composed of a superposition of positive and negative single waves. As a result the temporal variations of the runup elevation, the associated velocity and breaking criteria are specified in terms of polylogarithmic functions. Finally, we consider incoming transient wavetrains generated by monopole and dipole disturbances in the deep ocean. The evolution of these wavetrains, while travelling a considerable distance over a constant depth, is influenced by weak dispersion and is governed by the linear Korteweg-De Vries (KdV) equation. This process is described by a convolution integral involving the Airy function. The runup on the plane sloping beach is then determined by another convolution integral involving the incoming time series at the foot of the slope. A good agreement with numerical model results is demonstrated. Copyright {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2010.},

abstract = {At least 19 remarkable dikes and land reclamations have been constructed since 1970 along the west coast of Korea, which resulted in a reduction in tidal flat area of almost 50{\%}. Both the reduction in tidal flats and the artificially simplified coastal line have distorted the spatio-temporal tidal hydrodynamics; to quantify this, we analyzed and evaluated tidal asymmetry by phase differences of the principal semi-diurnal lunar constituent M2 and its first over-tide M4. Moreover, we applied the ADCIRC model to quantitatively investigate near- and far-field impacts on tidal variations using the gamma parameter, tidal energy flux, and dissipation rate. Through this study, we found that the tidal regime around the Incheon harbor area in Gyeonggi Bay has changed from ebb- to flood-dominant due to multiple nearby reclamations, in particular to the construction of the Siwha dike. The Saemangeum dike caused near-field de-amplification of M2 but far-field amplification in the Shandong area of China. In addition to allowing a traditional asymmetry approach using phase difference, analyses based on the gamma parameter and tidal energy variations could distinctly improve spatial understanding of anthropogenic impacts on coastal tidal hydrodynamics.},

The stress turns out to be quadratically related to the 10-m wind speed and linearly to the wind speed at a wavelength related level. The Charnock parameter (dimensionless roughness length) shows a pronounced correlation with wave age. This implies, due to a coupling between wave age and the steepness of the waves, a connection between the stress and the steepness. We find that our North Sea results are consistent with open ocean observations. For a given wind speed the mean stress at MPN turns out to be higher because the wave age there is in general lower. We define and give an expression for a drag coefficient at a wavelength related level that can be calculated straightforwardly from the wave age and then reduced to a standard level.},

The analysis of long-term tide gauge records identified an extreme sea-level rise (SLR) event during 2009-10. Within this 2-year period, the coastal sea level north of New York City jumped by 128 mm. This magnitude of interannual SLR is unprecedented (a 1-in-850 year event) during the entire history of the tide gauge records. Here we show that this extreme SLR event is a combined effect of two factors: an observed 30{\%} downturn of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation during 2009-10, and a significant negative North Atlantic Oscillation index. The extreme nature of the 2009-10 SLR event suggests that such a significant downturn of the Atlantic overturning circulation is very unusual. During the twenty-first century, climate models project an increase in magnitude and frequency of extreme interannual SLR events along this densely populated coast.},

abstract = {Positive vertical bias in elevation data derived from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) is known to cause substantial underestimation of coastal flood risks and exposure. Previous attempts to correct SRTM elevations have used regression to predict vertical error from a small number of auxiliary data products, but these efforts have been focused on reducing error introduced solely by vegetative land cover. Here, we employ a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network to perform a 23-dimensional vertical error regression analyses, where in addition to vegetation cover indices, we use variables including neighborhood elevation values, population density, land slope, and local SRTM deviations from ICESat altitude observations. Using lidar data as ground truth, we train the neural network on samples of US data from 1–20 m of elevation according to SRTM, and assess outputs with extensive testing sets in the US and Australia. Our adjustment system reduces mean vertical bias in the coastal US from 3.67 m to less than 0.01 m, and in Australia from 2.49 m to 0.11 m. RMSE is cut by roughly one-half at both locations, from 5.36 m to 2.39 m in the US, and from 4.15 m to 2.46 in Australia. Using ICESat data as a reference, we estimate that global bias falls from 1.88 m to −0.29 m, and RMSE from 4.28 m and 3.08 m. The methods presented here are flexible and effective, and can be effectively applied to land cover of all types, including dense urban development. The resulting enhanced global coastal DEM (CoastalDEM) promises to greatly improve the accuracy of sea level rise and coastal flood analyses worldwide.},

We find that the present model with a set of unified model coefficients can perform well for a variety of flows. The flows that are examined include: (i) rotating homogeneous shear flows; (ii) boundary-free shear flows including a mixing layer, planar and round jets; (iii) a channel flow, and flat plate boundary layers with and without a pressure gradient; and (iv) backward facing step separated flows. The model predictions are compared with available experimental data. The results from the standard k-ϵ eddy viscosity model are also included for comparison.

In this study, a high-fidelity fluid-structure interaction simulation that simultaneously considers the influence of aero-hydrodynamic coupling due to the dynamic motion of a FOWT has been conducted using computational fluid dynamics based on an overset grid technique. The DeepCwind semisubmersible floating platform with the NREL 5-MW baseline wind turbine model is considered for objective numerical verification with the NREL FAST code. A state-of-the-art computational model based on the coupled computational fluid dynamics and dynamic structure analysis is constructed and analyzed to solve multiphase flow, 6 degrees of freedom motions of OC4 semisubmersible FOWT. A quasi-static mooring solver is also applied to resolve the constraint motion of floater because of a 3-line mooring system. The influence of tower shadow on the unsteady aerodynamic performance and loads is also demonstrated. Finally, complex unsteady flow fields considering blade and tower interference effects among blade-tip vortices, shedding vortices, and turbulent wakes are numerically visualized and investigated in detail.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes the findings of a workshop convened in the United States in 2018 to discuss methods in coastal and estuarine modeling and to propose key areas of research and development needed to improve their accuracy and reliability. The focus of this paper is on physical processes, and we provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art based on presentations and discussions at the meeting, which revolved around the four primary themes of parameterizations, numerical methods, in-situ and remote-sensing measurements, and high-performance computing. A primary outcome of the workshop was agreement on the need to reduce subjectivity and improve reproducibility in modeling of physical processes in the coastal ocean. Reduction of subjectivity can be accomplished through development of standards for benchmarks, grid generation, and validation, and reproducibility can be improved through development of standards for input/output, coupling and model nesting, and reporting. Subjectivity can also be reduced through more engagement with the applied mathematics and computer science communities to develop methods for robust parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. Such engagement could be encouraged through more collaboration between the forward and inverse modeling communities and integration of more applied math and computer science into oceanography curricula. Another outcome of the workshop was agreement on the need to develop high-resolution models that scale on advanced HPC systems to resolve, rather than parameterize, processes with horizontal scales that range between the depth and the internal Rossby deformation scale. Unsurprisingly, more research is needed on parameterizations of processes at scales smaller than the depth, including parameterizations for drag (including bottom roughness, bedforms, vegetation and corals), wave breaking, and air-sea interactions under strong wind conditions. Other topics that require significantly more work to better parameterize include nearshore wave modeling, sediment transport modeling, and morphodynamics. Finally, it was agreed that coastal models should be considered as key infrastructure needed to support research, just like laboratory facilities, field instrumentation, and research vessels. This will require a shift in the way proposals related to coastal ocean modeling are reviewed and funded.},

abstract = {A bulk air-sea flux algorithm couples the ocean and the lower atmosphere through flux boundary conditions and can be used in various analyses and in numerical models. The algorithm described here has two features not present in any other existing bulk flux algorithm. First, it has a new air-sea drag relation. Here, for wind speeds above about 9 m s-1, the friction velocity u*, which is related to the square root of the surface stress, is linearly related to UN10, the neutral-stability 10 m wind speed. When extrapolated to hurricane-strength winds, this drag relation has better properties than relations formulated in terms of a drag coefficient or a roughness length. The second unique feature of this flux algorithm is that it recognizes two routes by which heat and moisture cross the air-sea interface: one is the interfacial route, which is controlled by molecular processes right at the air-sea interface; the second is the spray-mediated route, which is governed by microphysical processes at the surface of sea spray droplets. Through microphysical theory and our analysis of 4000 sets of eddy-covariance measurements of the scalar fluxes, we separate the measured fluxes into the interfacial and spray contributions and thereby produce the only spray flux algorithm tested and validated against oceanic data. Because all components of our flux algorithm are physics-based and validated with data for winds up to 25 m s-1, one application is extrapolating this algorithm to hurricane-strength winds, where sea spray plays a dominant role in scalar transfer.},

abstract = {Statistical approaches to study extreme events require, by definition, long time series of data. In many scientific disciplines, these series are often subject to variations at different temporal scales that affect the frequency and intensity of their extremes. Therefore, the assumption of stationarity is violated and alternative methods to conventional stationary extreme value analysis (EVA) must be adopted. Using the example of environmental variables subject to climate change, in this study we introduce the transformed-stationary (TS) methodology for non-stationary EVA. This approach consists of (i) transforming a non-stationary time series into a stationary one, to which the stationary EVA theory can be applied, and (ii) reverse transforming the result into a non-stationary extreme value distribution. As a transformation, we propose and discuss a simple time-varying normalization of the signal and show that it enables a comprehensive formulation of non-stationary generalized extreme value (GEV) and generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) models with a constant shape parameter. A validation of the methodology is carried out on time series of significant wave height, residual water level, and river discharge, which show varying degrees of long-term and seasonal variability. The results from the proposed approach are comparable with the results from (a) a stationary EVA on quasi-stationary slices of non-stationary series and (b) the established method for non-stationary EVA. However, the proposed technique comes with advantages in both cases. For example, in contrast to (a), the proposed technique uses the whole time horizon of the series for the estimation of the extremes, allowing for a more accurate estimation of large return levels. Furthermore, with respect to (b), it decouples the detection of non-stationary patterns from the fitting of the extreme value distribution. As a result, the steps of the analysis are simplified and intermediate diagnostics are possible. In particular, the transformation can be carried out by means of simple statistical techniques such as low-pass filters based on the running mean and the standard deviation, and the fitting procedure is a stationary one with a few degrees of freedom and is easy to implement and control.

Analysis of a 10-year time series of digital tide data from Magueyes Island, Puerto Rico, demonstrates that sea-level variance at the fundamental normal mode (sciche) frequency of the shelf has a pronounced fortnightly distribution with a maximum occurring 6–7 days after new and full moon. The sieche variance also shows a bimodal seasonal distribution with an inverse relationship to easterly wind stress. It is argued that the sciches are excited by internal waves generated by strong tides in the southeastern Caribbean. Support is provided by airborne radar imagery showing sea-surface patterns suggesting the presence of internal waves near the southern Aves Ridge, and by the results of two field experiments, carried out during times when large-amplitude sciches were expected, to search for evidence of internal wave forcing near the shelf br...},

abstract = {Tidal currents and surface amplitudes are calculated globally for the dominating diurnal and semidiurnal constituents using an established tidal model under a range of altered bathymetry. The purpose is to evaluate if the well-known amplification of the global tides during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is related to changed propagation properties for the tidal wave or to changed damping due to removal of shelf seas. The response of the tides and tidal dissipation to future sea-level rise is also discussed. The tides in the present and LGM oceans were simulated first, followed by runs where the present day bathymetry was used but the shelf seas removed by the introduction of vertical walls or where sea level is allowed to rise. Previously reported results regarding tidal amplitudes and dissipation rates are reproduced in the control runs. The runs without shelf seas show significantly enhanced tidal amplitudes in the North Atlantic, whereas sea-level rise of 5 m above present levels show a significant shift in the amphidromic points on a local and regional scale but had a limited effect on the open ocean tides. Simulations with very large sea-level rise show a significantly decreased global tidal dissipation, whereas experiments without friction in present-day shallow water display results similar to those with no shelf seas. The results all point towards changing damping properties due to the removal of shelf seas as being the mechanism behind the LGM amplification, and they imply the importance of implementing future sea-level changes properly in tidal simulations.},

abstract = {When river and coastal floods coincide, their impacts are often worse than when they occur in isolation; such floods are examples of ‘compound events'. To better understand the impacts of these compound events, we require an improved understanding of the dependence between coastal and river flooding on a global scale. Therefore, in this letter, we: provide the first assessment and mapping of the dependence between observed high sea-levels and high river discharge for deltas and estuaries around the globe; and demonstrate how this dependence may influence the joint probability of floods exceeding both the design discharge and design sea-level. The research was carried out by analysing the statistical dependence between observed sea-levels (and skew surge) from the GESLA-2 dataset, and river discharge using gauged data from the Global Runoff Data Centre, for 187 combinations of stations across the globe. Dependence was assessed using Kendall's rank correlation coefficient () and copula models. We find significant dependence for skew surge conditional on annual maximum discharge at 22{\%} of the stations studied, and for discharge conditional on annual maximum skew surge at 36{\%} of the stations studied. Allowing a time-lag between the two variables up to 5 days, we find significant dependence for skew surge conditional on annual maximum discharge at 56{\%} of stations, and for discharge conditional on annual maximum skew surge at 54{\%} of stations. Using copula models, we show that the joint exceedance probability of events in which both the design discharge and design sea-level are exceeded can be several magnitudes higher when the dependence is considered, compared to when independence is assumed. We discuss several implications, showing that flood risk assessments in these regions should correctly account for these joint exceedance probabilities.},

abstract = {A semi-automated vertical feature terrain extraction algorithm is described and applied to a two-dimensional, depth-integrated, shallow water equation inundation model. The extracted features describe what are commonly sub-mesh scale elevation details (ridge and valleys), which may be ignored in standard practice because adequate mesh resolution cannot be afforded. The extraction algorithm is semi-automated, requires minimal human intervention, and is reproducible. A lidar-derived digital elevation model (DEM) of coastal Mississippi and Alabama serves as the source data for the vertical feature extraction. Unstructured mesh nodes and element edges are aligned to the vertical features and an interpolation algorithm aimed at minimizing topographic elevation error assigns elevations to mesh nodes via the DEM. The end result is a mesh that accurately represents the bare earth surface as derived from lidar with element resolution in the floodplain ranging from 15 m to 200 m. To examine the influence of the inclusion of vertical features on overland flooding, two additional meshes were developed, one without crest elevations of the features and another with vertical features withheld. All three meshes were incorporated into a SWAN+ADCIRC model simulation of Hurricane Katrina. Each of the three models resulted in similar validation statistics when compared to observed time-series water levels at gages and post-storm collected high water marks. Simulated water level peaks yielded an R2 of 0.97 and upper and lower 95{\%} confidence interval of ∼ ± 0.60 m. From the validation at the gages and HWM locations, it was not clear which of the three model experiments performed best in terms of accuracy. Examination of inundation extent among the three model results were compared to debris lines derived from NOAA post-event aerial imagery, and the mesh including vertical features showed higher accuracy. The comparison of model results to debris lines demonstrates that additional validation techniques are necessary for state-of-the-art flood inundation models. In addition, the semi-automated, unstructured mesh generation process presented herein increases the overall accuracy of simulated storm surge across the floodplain without reliance on hand digitization or sacrificing computational cost.},

abstract = {The coastal areas of the North-Western Mediterranean Sea are one of the most challenging places for ocean forecasting. This region is exposed to severe storms events that are of short duration. During these events, significant air-sea interactions, strong winds and large sea-state can have catastrophic consequences in the coastal areas. To investigate these air-sea interactions and the oceanic response to such events, we implemented the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport Modeling System simulating a severe storm in the Mediterranean Sea that occurred in May 2010. During this event, wind speed reached up to 25 m.s-1 inducing significant sea surface cooling (up to 2°C) over the Gulf of Lion (GoL) and along the storm track, and generating surface waves with a significant height of 6 m. It is shown that the event, associated with a cyclogenesis between the Balearic Islands and the GoL, is relatively well reproduced by the coupled system. A surface heat budget analysis showed that ocean vertical mixing was a major contributor to the cooling tendency along the storm track and in the GoL where turbulent heat fluxes also played an important role. Sensitivity experiments on the ocean-atmosphere coupling suggested that the coupled system is sensitive to the momentum flux parameterization as well as air-sea and air-wave coupling. Comparisons with available atmospheric and oceanic observations showed that the use of the fully coupled system provides the most skillful simulation, illustrating the benefit of using a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere-wave model for the assessment of these storm events.},

Estimates of vertical energy flux based on a previously developed model are adjusted to account for the influence of finite depth, varying stratification, and two-dimensional topography. Specific estimates of energy flux are made for midocean ridge topography. Weakly nonlinear theory is applied to the wave generation at idealized topography to examine finite amplitude corrections to the linear theory. Most internal tide energy is generated at low modes associated with spatial scales from roughly 20 to 100 km. The Richardson number of the radiated internal tide typically exceeds unity for these motions, and so direct shear instability of the generated waves is not the dominant energy transfer mechanism. It also seems that wave–wave interactions are ineffective at transferring energy from the large wavelengths that dominate the energy flux. Instead, it appears that most of ...},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to model the interactions between fluids and solids using fully nonlinear models. Nonlinearity is important in the context of floating wind turbines, for example, to model breaking waves impacting on the structure and the effect of the solid's elasticity. The fluid-and solid-dynamics equations are solved using two unstructured finite-element models, which are coupled at every time step. Importantly, the coupling ensures that the action-reaction principle is satisfied at a discrete level, independently of the order of representation of the discrete fields. To the authors' knowledge, the present algorithm is novel in that it can simultaneously handle: (i) nonmatching fluid and solid meshes, (ii) different polynomial orders of the basis functions on each mesh, and (iii) different fluid and solid time steps. First, results are shown for the flow past a fixed actuator-disk immersed in a uniform flow and representing a wind turbine. The present numerical results for the velocity deficit induced by the disk are shown to be in good agreement with the semi-analytical solution, for three values of thrust coefficients. The presence of a non-zero fluid viscosity in the numerical simulation affects wake recovery and fluid entrainment around the disk. Second, the dynamic response of a cylindrical pile is computed when placed at an interface between air and water. The results qualitatively demonstrate that the present models are applicable to the modelling of multiple fluids interacting with a floating solid. This work provides a first-step towards the fully coupled simulation of offshore wind turbines supported by a floating spar. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {This paper reviews historical methods for estimating surge hazards and con- cludes that the class of solutions produced with Joint Probability Method (JPM) solutions provides a much more stable estimate of hazard levels than alternative methods. We proceed to describe changes in our understanding of the winds in hurricanes approaching a coast and the physics of surge generation that have required recent modifications to pro- cedures utilized in earlier JPM studies. Of critical importance to the accuracy of hazard estimates is the ability to maintain a high level of fidelity in the numerical simulations while allowing for a sufficient number of simulations to populate the joint probability matrices for the surges. To accomplish this, it is important to maximize the information content in the sample storm set to be simulated. This paper introduces the fundamentals of a method based on the functional specification of the surge response for this purpose, along with an example of its application in the New Orleans area. A companion paper in this special issue (Irish et al. 2009) provides details of the portion of this new method related to interpolating/extrapolating along spatial dimensions.},

This significantly improves the linear dispersion properties of the Boussinesq equations, making them applicable to a wider range of water depths. A finite difference method is used to solve the equations. Numerical and experimental results are compared for the propagation of regular and irregular waves on a constant slope beach.

Although some efforts have been made to determine tsunami loads on structures, there are discrepancies between the limited number of published design guidelines. This study comprises an experimental investigation of a tsunami bore interaction with an inland structure. Physical modelling of the tsunami bore in the laboratory allowed study of the impact of tsunami bores on a square prism model having different orientations to the flow direction. The use of common geometrical shapes simplifies experiments and increases the reliability of results. The experiments were conducted in a 14m long, 1.2m wide and 0.8m deep wave flume equipped with an automatic gate designed to generate a tsunami bore. Measurements were made of the forces and pressures exerted on the model structure and of the bore heights and velocities. The vertical pressure distribution was measured on what was initially the structure's front wall, with the front wall at 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90° and 135° to its original alignment. A relation between bore velocity and bore height is presented. The measured maximum forces in the stream-wise and upward directions were numerically modelled successfully, and relevant drag coefficients were determined for the structure at different orientations.},

Beaches are the interface between land and ocean, providing coastal protection from marine storms and cyclones3. However the presence of sandy beaches cannot be taken for granted, as they are under constant change, driven by meteorological4,5, geological6 and anthropogenic factors1,7. A substantial proportion of the world's sandy coastline is already eroding1,7, a situation that could be exacerbated by climate change8,9. Here, we show that ambient trends in shoreline dynamics, combined with coastal recession driven by sea level rise, could result in the near extinction of almost half of the world's sandy beaches by the end of the century. Moderate GHG emission mitigation could prevent 40{\%} of shoreline retreat. Projected shoreline dynamics are dominated by sea level rise for the majority of sandy beaches, but in certain regions the erosive trend is counteracted by accretive ambient shoreline changes; for example, in the Amazon, East and Southeast Asia and the north tropical Pacific. A substantial proportion of the threatened sandy shorelines are in densely populated areas, underlining the need for the design and implementation of effective adaptive measures.},

abstract = {In recent years, high-resolution ("eddying") global three-dimensional ocean general circulation models have begun to include astronomical tidal forcing alongside atmospheric forcing. Such models can carry an internal tide field with a realistic amount of nonstationarity, and an internal gravity wave continuum spectrum that compares more closely with observations as model resolution increases. Global internal tide and gravity wave models are important for understanding the three-dimensional geography of ocean mixing, for operational oceanography, and for simulating and interpreting satellite altimeter observations. Here we describe the most important technical details behind such models, including atmospheric forcing, bathymetry, astronomical tidal forcing, self-attraction and loading, quadratic bottom boundary layer drag, parameterized topographic internal wave drag, shallow-water tidal equations, and a brief summary of the theory of linear internal gravity waves. We focus on simulations run with two models, the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm). We compare the modeled internal tides and internal gravity wave continuum to satellite altimeter observations, moored observational records, and the predictions of the Garrett-Munk (1975) internal gravity wave continuum spectrum. We briefly examine specific topics of interest, such as tidal energetics, internal tide nonstationarity, and the role of nonlinearities in generating the modeled internal gravity wave continuum. We also describe our first attempts at using a Kalman filter to improve the accuracy of tides embedded within a general circulation model. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of modeling stationary internal tides, non-stationary internal tides, and the internal gravity wave continuum spectrum for satellite altimetry and other applications.},

Application of shallow water models to large scale problems requires the use of spherical coordinates: this is the case, for instance, of the simulation of the propagation of a Tsunami wave through the ocean. Although the PDE system is similar to the shallow water equations in Cartesian coordinates, new source terms appear. As a consequence, the derivation of high order numerical methods that preserve water at rest solutions is not as straightforward as in that case. Finite Volume methods are considered based on a first order path-conservative scheme and high order reconstruction operators. Numerical methods based on these ingredients have been successfully applied previously to the nonlinear SWEs in Cartesian coordinates. Some numerical tests to check the well-balancing and high order properties of the scheme, as well as its ability to simulate planetary waves or tsunami waves over realistic bathymetries are presented.},

In agreement with previous studies, this work indicates that the changes in atmospheric storminess and the higher time-average sea-level predicted for the end of the twenty-first century will lead to changes in the height of water levels measured relative to the present day tide. However, the details of these projections differ somewhat from earlier assessments. Uncertainty in projections of future extreme water levels arise from uncertainty in the amount and timing of future greenhouse gas emissions, uncertainty in the physical models used to simulate the climate system and from the natural variability of the system. The total uncertainty has not yet been reliably quantified and achieving this should be a priority for future research. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of storm surge is a difficult problem. Most forecast systems produce multiple possible forecasts depending on the variability in weather conditions, possible temperature levels, winds, etc. Ensemble modeling techniques have been developed with the stated purpose of obtaining the best forecast (in some specific sense) from the individual forecasts. In this work a statistical methodology of evaluating the performance of multiple ensemble forecasting models is developed. The methodology is applied to predicting storm surge in the New York Harbor area. Data from three hurricane events collected from multiple locations in the New York Bay area are used. The methodology produces three key findings for the particular test data used. First, it is found that even the simplest possible way of creating an ensemble produces results superior to those of any single forecast. Second, for the data used and the events under study the methodology did not interact with any event at any location studied. Third, based on the methodology results for the data studied selecting the best-performing ensemble models for each specific location may be possible.},

Documented costs to date include ¥2.9 trillion in insurance payouts and ¥17.7 trillion in response and recovery budgets by the national government that will be financed largely by tax increases and bonds. In the regions with physical damage, fisheries and agriculture, among other sectors, were very hard hit. The disaster also caused measurable economic impacts well beyond the damage regions, including losses in gross domestic product (GDP), in manufacturing from supply-chain disruptions, and in retail trade and tourism due to restrained consumption and radiation fears. Reduced capacity for generating electricity has led to substantial energy conservation nationwide. Results from applying a loss estimation model demonstrated good agreement with observed post-disaster economic activity. {\textcopyright} 2013, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This research details the development and validation of the updated Eastern North Pacific (ENPAC) constituent tidal database, referred to as ENPAC15. The database was last updated in 2003 and was developed using the two-dimensional, depth integrated form of the ADvanced CIRCulation coastal hydrodynamic model, ADCIRC. Regional databases, such as ENPAC15, are capable of providing higher resolution near the coast, allowing users to more accurately define tidal forcing for smaller sub-regions. This study follows the same methodology as the EC2015 updates for the eastern coast of the United States and six main areas of improvement in the modeling configurations are examined: (1) placement of the open ocean boundary; (2) higher coastal resolution; (3) updated global bathymetry; (4) updated boundary forcing using two global tidal databases; (5) updated bottom friction formulations; and (6) improved model physics by incorporating the advective terms in ADCIRC. The skill of the improved database is compared to that of its predecessor and is calculated using harmonic data from three sources. Overall, the ENPAC15 database significantly (52{\%} globally) reduces errors in the ENPAC03 database and improves the quality of tidal constituents available for sub-regional models in the ENPAC region.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

There are many sources of error. The initial profile, determined with seismic data, can even be different from the actual tsunami profile. The numerical scheme introduces errors. Nonlinearity near and on land requires an appropriate selection of equations. Taking these facts into account, it should be noted that numerical simulations produce satisfactory information for practical use, because the final error is usually within 15{\%} as far as the maximum run-up height is concerned. The state-of-the-art of tsunami numerical simulations is critically summarized from generation to run-up. Problems in the near future are also stated.

abstract = {The development of models of the ocean tides with higher resolution near coastlines and coarser resolution offshore, has been required to account for the significant impacts of coastline configuration and bathymetry (associated with sea level rise) on both the amplitude and phase of tidal constituents. This capability becomes especially important in the context of tidal analyses at times in the past when sea levels are known to have differed significantly from present. Here we present a novel global model based on the discontinuous Galerkin disretization of the shallow water equations that employs third order Runge-Kutta time stepping on unstructured triangular grids. The model has been efficiently parallelized and is thereby shown to achieve essentially perfect linear scaling which makes it suitable for the generation of extremely high resolution results in local regions of interest.The paper includes a detailed development of the mathematical and numerical framework which is first tested in the context of analyses of a series of well established aquaplanet benchmarks for the shallow water equations on the sphere. These benchmarks include: (1) steady state nonlinear geostrophic flow in the context of an hp convergence study, (2) Rossby wave response arising from a geostrophic flow impinging on localized topography and (3) development of barotropic instability in a perturbed balanced zonal flow. For our target tidal applications the basic shallow water system is extended to include the influence of internal tide-related drag in the deep ocean as well as the drag in shallow marginal seas together with the influence of gravitational self-attraction and loading. Global tidal simulations with various offshore and coastal resolutions are compared with the standard benchmark based upon satellite altimetry data. Initial investigations of the M2 tidal amplitude, phase and energy budget are provided and shown to be highly satisfactory at the level of resolution for which results are provided. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The present study investigates changes in the location, frequency, intensity, and dynamical processes of North Atlantic extratropical cyclones with warming consistent with the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario. The modeling, analysis, and prediction (MAP) climatology of midlatitude storminess (MCMS) feature-tracking algorithm was utilized to analyze 10 cold-season high-resolution atmospheric simulations over the North Atlantic region in current and future climates. Enhanced extratropical cyclone activity is most evident in the northeast North Atlantic and off the U.S. East Coast. These changes in cyclone activity are offset from changes in eddy kinetic energy and eddy heat flux. Investigation of the minimum SLP reached at each grid point reveals a lack of correspondence between the strongest events in the current and future simulations, indicating the future simulations produced a different population of storms. Examination of the percent change of storms in the storm-track region shows a reduction in the number of strong storms (i.e., those reaching a minimum SLP perturbation of at least -51 hPa). Storm-relative composites of strong and moderate storms show an increase in precipitation, associated with enhanced latent heat release and strengthening of the 900-700-hPa layer-average potential vorticity (PV). Other structural changes found for cyclones in a future climate include weakened upper-level PV for strong storms and a weakened near-surface potential temperature anomaly for moderate storms, demonstrating a change in storm dynamics. Furthermore, the impacts associated with extratropical cyclones, such as strong near-surface winds and heavy precipitation, strengthen and become more frequent with warming.},

abstract = {The amount and extent of coastal flooding caused by hurricanes can be sensitive to the timing or speed of the storm. For storms moving parallel to the coast, the hazards can be stretched over a larger area. Hurricane Matthew was a powerful storm that impacted the southeastern U.S. during October 2016, moving mostly parallel to the coastline from Florida through North Carolina. In this study, three sources for atmospheric forcing are considered for a simulation of Matthew's water levels, which are validated against extensive observations, and then the storm's effects are explored on this long coastline. It is hypothesized that the spatial variability of Matthew's effects on total water levels is partly due to the surge interacting nonlinearly with tides. By changing the time of occurrence of the storm, differences in storm surge are observed in different regions due to the storm coinciding with other periods in the tidal cycles. These differences are found to be as large as 1 m and comparable to the tidal amplitude. A change in forward speed of the storm also should alter its associated flooding due to differences in the duration over which the storm impacts the coastal waters. With respect to the forward speed, the present study contributes to established results by considering the scenario of a shore-parallel hurricane. A faster storm caused an increase in peak water levels along the coast but a decrease in the overall volume of inundation. On the other hand, a slower storm pushed more water into the estuaries and bays and flooded a larger section of the coast. Implications for short-term forecasting and long-term design studies for storms moving parallel to long coastlines are discussed herein.},

In the shallow and mostly unstratified western basin circulation is driven by Detroit River inflow (modified to some extent by wind) and is from west to east. In the central basin (which is of intermediate depth and has a relatively flat bottom), the modeled circulation is anticyclonic (clockwise), driven by anticyclonic vorticity in the surface wind, and the thermocline is bowl-shaped, in line with observations. In the deep part of the eastern basin, the thermocline is dome-shaped and circulation is cyclonic (counter-clockwise), due to density gradients (a configuration typical for other large deep lakes), while shallower areas are occupied by anticyclonic circulation driven by anticyclonic wind vorticity. In the central basin, modeled temperature and circulation patterns are quite sensitive to the specification of the wind field.

The adoption of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction9 and the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change Impacts10 have made these efforts even more essential.  However, GFRMs have their limits compared with local-scale models11, and there is often a mismatch between their actual ability and the envisaged use by practitioners.

abstract = {The coastal zones are facing the prospect of changing storm surge statistics due to anthropogenic climate change. In the present study, we examine these prospects for the North Sea based on numerical modelling. The main tool is the barotropic tide-surge model TRIMGEO (Tidal Residual and Intertidal Mudflat Model) to derive storm surge climate and extremes from atmospheric conditions. The analysis is carried out by using an ensemble of four 30-year atmospheric regional simulations under present-day and possible future-enhanced greenhouse gas conditions. The atmospheric regional simulations were prepared within the EU project PRUDENCE (Prediction of Regional scenarios and Uncertainties for Defining EuropeaN Climate change risks and Effects). The research strategy of PRUDENCE is to compare simulations of different regional models driven by the same global control and climate change simulations. These global conditions, representative for 1961-1990 and 2071-2100 were prepared by the Hadley Center based on the IPCC A2 SRES scenario. The results suggest that under future climatic conditions, storm surge extremes may increase along the North Sea coast towards the end of this century. Based on a comparison between the results of the different ensemble members as well as on the variability estimated from a high-resolution storm surge reconstruction of the recent decades it is found that this increase is significantly different from zero at the 95{\%} confidence level for most of the North Sea coast. An exception represents the East coast of the UK which is not affected by this increase of storm surge extremes.},

abstract = {Abyssal hills, which are pervasive landforms on the seafloor of the Earths oceans, represent a potential tectonic record of the history of midocean ridge spreading. However, the most detailed global maps of the seafloor, derived from the satellite altimetrybased gravity field, cannot be used to deterministically characterize such smallscale ({\textless}10 km) morphology. Nevertheless, the smallscale variability of the gravity field can be related to the statistical properties of abyssal hill morphology using the upward continuation formulation. In this paper, I construct a global prediction of abyssal hill rootmeansquare (rms) heights from the smallscale variability of the altimetric gravity field. The abyssal hillrelated component of the gravity field is derived by first masking distinct features, such as seamounts, midocean ridges, and continental margins, and then applying a newly designed adaptive directional filter algorithm to remove fracture zone/discontinuity fabric. A noise field is derived empirically by correlating the rms variability of the smallscale gravity field to the altimetric noise field in regions of very low relief, and the noise variance is subtracted from the smallscale gravity variance. Suites of synthetically derived, abyssal hill formed gravity fields are generated as a function of water depth, basement rms heights, and sediment thickness and used to predict abyssal hill seafloor rms heights from corrected smallscale gravity rms height. The resulting global prediction of abyssal hill rms heights is validated qualitatively by comparing against expected variations in abyssal hill morphology and quantitatively by comparing against actual measurements of rms heights. Although there is scatter, the prediction appears unbiased.},

abstract = {In 2005 Geoscience Australia and the National Oceans Office undertook a joint project to produce a consistent, high-quality 9 arc second (0.0025{\^{A}}° or {\~{}}250m at the equator) bathymetric grid for Australian waters. In 2009 a number of new datasets were included in an updated version of the grid. The 2009 bathymetric grid of Australia has been produced to include recently acquired datasets, and solutions to issues identified in the previous version. The revised grid has the same extents as its 2005 counterpart, including the Australian water column jurisdiction lying between 92{\^{A}}° E and 172{\^{A}}° E, and 8{\^{A}}° S and 60{\^{A}}° S. The waters adjacent to the continent of Australia and Tasmania are included, as are areas surrounding Macquarie Island, and the Australian Territories of Norfolk Island, Christmas Island, and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The area selected does not include Australia's marine jurisdiction offshore from the Territory of Heard and McDonald Islands and the Australian Antarctic Territory. This report details the datasets and procedures used to produce the 2009 bathymetric grid of Australia. As per the 2005 grid, the 0.0025 decimal degree (dd) resolution is only supported where direct bathymetric observations are sufficiently dense (e.g. where swath bathymetry data or digitised chart data exist) (Webster and Petkovic, 2005). In areas where no sounding data are available (in waters off the Australian shelf), the grid is based on the 2 arc minute ETOPO (Smith and Sandwell, 1997) and 1 arc minute ETOPO (Amante and Eakins, 2008) satellite derived bathymetry. The topographic data (on shore data) is based on the revised Australian 0.0025dd topography grid (Geoscience Australia, 2008), the 0.0025dd NZ topography grid (Geographx, 2008) and the 90m SRTM DEM (Jarvis et al, 2008). The final dataset has been provided in ESRI grid and ER Mapper (ers) formats. An associated shapefile has been produced so that the user can identify the input datasets that were used in the final grid. IMPORTANT INFORMATION This grid is not suitable for use as an aid to navigation, or to replace any products produced by the Australian Hydrographic Service. Geoscience Australia produces the 0.0025dd bathymetric grid of Australia specifically to provide regional and local broad scale context for scientific and industry projects, and public education. The 0.0025dd grid size is, in many regions of this grid, far in excess of the optimal grid size for some of the input data used. On parts of the continental shelf it may be possible to produce grids at higher resolution, especially where LADS or multibeam surveys exist. However these surveys typically only cover small areas and hence do not warrant the production a regional scale grid at less than 0.0025dd. There are a number of bathymetric datasets that have not been included in this grid for various reasons. Comments or queries about the data included in the grid (or excluded) can be directed to: IDEASRequests@ga.gov.au. This grid is not suitable for use as an aid to navigation, or to replace any products produced by the Australian Hydrographic Service.},

abstract = {This study characterises the shape of the flow separation zone (FSZ) and wake region over large asymmetric bedforms under tidal flow conditions. High resolution bathymetry, flow velocity and turbulence data were measured along two parallel transects in a tidal channel covered with bedforms. The field data are used to verify the applicability of a numerical model for a systematic study using the Delft3D modelling system and test the model sensitivity to roughness length. Three experiments are then conducted to investigate how the FSZ size and wake extent vary depending on tidally-varying flow conditions, water levels and bathymetry. During the ebb, a large FSZ occurs over the steep lee side of each bedform. During the flood, no flow separation develops over the bedforms having a flat crest; however, a small FSZ is observed over the steepest part of the crest of some bedforms, where the slope is locally up to 15°. Over a given bedform morphology and constant water levels, no FSZ occurs for velocity magnitudes smaller than 0.1ms-1; as the flow accelerates, the FSZ reaches a stable size for velocity magnitudes greater than 0.4ms-1. The shape of the FSZ is not influenced by changes in water levels. On the other hand, variations in bed morphology, as recorded from the high-resolution bathymetry collected during the tidal cycle, influence the size and position of the FSZ: a FSZ develops only when the maximum lee side slope over a horizontal distance of 5m is greater than 10°. The height and length of the wake region are related to the length of the FSZ. The total roughness along the transect lines is an order of magnitude larger during the ebb than during the flood due to flow direction in relation to bedform asymmetry: during the ebb, roughness is created by the large bedforms because a FSZ and wake develops over the steep lee side. The results add to the understanding of hydrodynamics of natural bedforms in a tidal environment and may be used to better parameterise small-scale processes in large-scale studies.},

abstract = {Details of a new model of water waves that describes wave propagation over long distances accurately, at low cost, and for a wide variety of physical situations are given. The analysis and numerical methods selected for computer solution are given in some detail. The model uses exact prognostic equations, and a high-order expansion to relate variables at each time step. The accuracy of the model is demonstrated most completely for solitary wave propagation, where model results are compared to exact results. It is found that the model results are much more accurate for high solitary waves than are earlier, Boussinesq-type theories, and give good results for waves so high that they are almost breaking. The capability of the model to treat a variety of situations is demonstrated for colliding solitary waves, nonlinear dispersive wave trains, waves in channels of varying breadth, and undular bores. Formally, the model incorporates nonlinear long wave theory exactly, incorporates enough dispersion to describe linear waves with fourth-order precision, so that both shallow water waves and deep water waves are included, and describes accurately waves for which dispersive and nonlinear effects are both important.},

abstract = {El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) strongly influences the global climate system, affecting hydrology in many of the world's river basins. This raises the prospect of ENSO-driven variability in global and regional hydroelectric power generation. Here we study these effects by generating time series of power production for 1593 hydropower dams, which collectively represent more than half of the world's existing installed hydropower capacity. The time series are generated by forcing a detailed dam model with monthly-resolution, 20th century inflows—the model includes plant specifications, storage dynamics and realistic operating schemes, and runs irrespectively of the dam construction year. More than one third of simulated dams exhibit statistically significant annual energy production anomalies in at least one of the two ENSO phases of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a. For most dams, the variability of relative anomalies in power production tends to be less than that of the forcing inflows—a consequence of dam design specifications, namely maximum turbine release rate and reservoir storage, which allows inflows to accumulate for power generation in subsequent dry years. Production is affected most prominently in Northwest United States, South America, Central America, the Iberian Peninsula, Southeast Asia and Southeast Australia. When aggregated globally, positive and negative energy production anomalies effectively cancel each other out, resulting in a weak and statistically insignificant net global anomaly for both ENSO phases.},

abstract = {CO-OPS stations recorded higher than normal sea levels (SL) along the U.S. East Coast in June and July 2009. Near-peak levels in the latter half of June coincided with a perigean-spring tide, an extreme predicted tide when the moon is closest to the Earth during a spring tide. This tidal event added to the observed SL anomaly, produced minor coastal flooding, and caught the attention of many coastal communities because of the lack of coastal storms that normally cause such anomalies. In terms of SL heights, the event was not very abnormal as many locations have higher levels in the late-summer. June July 2009 SL heights are anomalous because of their unexpected timing and geographic scope. The SL event is anomalous in terms of its residual values unaccounted for within the predictions of the earth-moon-sun tides and normal seasonal cycles of the winds and atmospheric pressure, ocean currents, and heating/cooling of coastal waters. The mean residual SL values for June 2009 were significant ( 0.2 m) from North Carolina to New Jersey, substantial ( 0.1 m) from Florida to Maine, and the most extreme to occur simultaneously over the entire East Coast during a spring/summer period as far back as 1980. There are two probable mechanisms responsible for the June July 2009 high SL residuals. The first is northeasterly (NE) wind forcing. In June 2009, winds over the entire geographic area from Cape Hatteras, NC to the Gulf of Maine had a moderate NE wind component, whose transport caused coastal SL to rise. South of Cape Hatteras, winds were primarily southwesterly (SW). The other mechanism is the changing transport of the Florida Current, which is measured in the Florida Straits before it supplies the Gulf Steam off of Cape Hatteras, NC. When the Florida Current / Gulf Stream transport is low, the eastward-rising cross-current slope relaxes and raises coastal SL. In June 2009, the SL residual rise was concurrent with a noted decrease in transport of the Florida Current. The June July 2009 SL event decays in mid-July 2009 as the SL residuals diminish. During this period, transport of the Florida Current sharply increases and the winds oscillate between SW and NE along the East Coast. The June July 2009 SL anomaly is unique in that the NE winds were not at a multi-year high or the Florida Current transport at its low. But the coupled effect of the two forces created SL residuals that were at highest levels all along the East Coast. Highest SL residuals between North Carolina and New Jersey highlight the region of greatest overlap of the two forces.},

Scituate Harbor (MA) was chosen as the extratropical storm testbed site, and model simulations were made for the 24–27 May 2005 and 17–20 April 2007 (“Patriot's Day Storm”) nor'easters. For the same unstructured mesh, meteorological forcing, and initial/boundary conditions, intermodel comparisons were made for tidal elevation, surface waves, sea surface elevation, coastal inundation, currents, and volume transport. All three models showed similar accuracy in tidal simulation and consistency in dynamic responses to storm winds in experiments conducted without and with wave-current interaction. The three models also showed that wave-current interaction could (1) change the current direction from the along-shelf direction to the onshore direction over the northern shelf, enlarging the onshore water transport and (2) intensify an anticyclonic eddy in the harbor entrance and a cyclonic eddy in the harbor interior, which could increase the water transport toward the northern peninsula and the southern end and thus enhance flooding in those areas. The testbed intermodel comparisons suggest that major differences in the performance of the three models were caused primarily by (1) the inclusion of wave-current interaction, due to the different discrete algorithms used to solve the three wave models and compute water-current interaction, (2) the criterions used for the wet-dry point treatment of the flooding/drying process simulation, and (3) bottom friction parameterizations.},

abstract = {Tides and their dynamic processes in the South China Sea (SCS) are studied by assimilating Topex/Poseidon altimetry data into a barotropic ocean tide model for the eight major constituents (M2 S2 K1 O1 N2 K2 P1 Q1) using a tidal data inversion scheme. High resolution (∼10km) and large model domain are adopted to better resolve the physical processes involved and to minimize the uncertainty from the open boundary condition. The model results, which are optimized by an inversion scheme, compare well with tidal gauge measurements. The study reveals that the amplitude of the semi-diurnal tide, M2, decreases, while the amplitude of the diurnal tide, K1, increases similar to the Helmholtz resonance after the tidal waves propagate from the western Pacific into the SCS through the Luzon Strait (LS). Analyses of the energy studies show that the LS is a place where both M2 and K1 tidal energy dissipates the most, and strong M2 tidal dissipation also occurs in the Taiwan Strait (TS). The work rate of the tidal generating force in the SCS basin is negative for M2 and positive for K1. It is found that the responses of tides in the SCS are largely associated with the propagating directions of the tides in the Pacific, the tidal frequency, the wavelengths, the local geometry and bottom topography.},

abstract = {Understanding the processes responsible for coastal change is important for managing our coastal resources, both natural and economic. The current scientific understanding of coastal sediment transport and geology suggests that examining coastal processes at regional scales can lead to significant insight into how the coastal zone evolves. To better identify the significant processes affecting our coastlines and how those processes create coastal change we developed a Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport (COAWST) Modeling System, which is comprised of the Model Coupling Toolkit to exchange data fields between the ocean model ROMS, the atmosphere model WRF, the wave model SWAN, and the sediment capabilities of the Community Sediment Transport Model. This formulation builds upon previous developments by coupling the atmospheric model to the ocean and wave models, providing one-way grid refinement in the ocean model, one-way grid refinement in the wave model, and coupling on refined levels. Herein we describe the modeling components and the data fields exchanged. The modeling system is used to identify model sensitivity by exchanging prognostic variable fields between different model components during an application to simulate Hurricane Isabel during September 2003. Results identify that hurricane intensity is extremely sensitive to sea surface temperature. Intensity is reduced when coupled to the ocean model although the coupling provides a more realistic simulation of the sea surface temperature. Coupling of the ocean to the atmosphere also results in decreased boundary layer stress and coupling of the waves to the atmosphere results in increased bottom stress. Wave results are sensitive to both ocean and atmospheric coupling due to wave-current interactions with the ocean and wave growth from the atmosphere wind stress. Sediment resuspension at regional scale during the hurricane is controlled by shelf width and wave propagation during hurricane approach. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {The run-up of nonbreaking and breaking solitary waves on plane impermeable beaches is investigated with a Lagrangian finite-element Boussinesq wave model. Wave breaking is parameterized with an artificial viscosity (diffusion) term in the momentum equation, and bottom friction is modelled with a term quadratic in the horizontal fluid velocity. Comparisons are presented with laboratory data of maximum run-up, shoreline motion, and spatial profiles of near-shore free-surface elevation for both steep (20°) and gradual (2.88°) slopes. For the steep slope, only waves which do not break on run-up are considered, and excellent agreement is obtained with the laboratory data. For the gradual slope, wave shoaling, breaking, bore formation and subsequent collapse at the shoreline are predicted well by the model, although the breaking algorithm does not attempt to model the details of the turbulent flow in the breaking region. The backwash bore is also modelled reasonably well, although it persists longer in the numerical computations than in the laboratory data. It is shown that the inclusion of nonhydrostatic effects reduces the tendency of waves to break and improves the agreement of the numerical results with the laboratory run-up data. This allows higher amplitude waves to be modelled and larger propagation distances to be treated without the need to limit the wave steepness with artificial dissipation.},

abstract = {Barotropic and baroclinic tides were simulated for the Indonesia Seas using a primitive equation, terrain-following coordinate model, the Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS) with four tidal constituents (M2, S2, K1, and O1). The region's intricate topography as well as interactions between the Pacific and Indian Ocean tides within the Indonesian Seas resulted in complex barotropic and baroclinic tidal fields. The semidiurnal tides entered from both the Pacific and Indian oceans converging in Makassar Strait and the Ceram Sea with an amphidromic point forming in the Timor Sea. Diurnal tides were dominated by the Pacific Ocean tide. The model successfully replicated the observed tidal elevation fields as determined from TOPEX/POSEIDON crossovers with better performance for the semidiurnal constituents, RMS differences of 4{\&}{\#}8211;6 cm, than the diurnal constituents, RMS differences of 7{\&}{\#}8211;10 cm. A baroclinic response was apparent in the elevations, and the locations of the observed baroclinic elevation response in TOPEX/POSEIDON data agreed with that of the model. Velocities were baroclinic for all constituents with high spatial variability, particularly near sills and in straits. Extensive interactions occurred in the internal tidal fields: between a beam and its own reflections, between internal tides generated at different locations (i.e., different sides of a channel, or beams generated nearby), and between the barotropic and baroclinic tidal beams. Owing to propagation, even regions {\textgreater}100 km from sills showed significant vertical and horizontal variability resulting from internal tides. This resulted in extremely complex internal tidal fields with high variability, both spatially and temporally during a tidal cycle.},

abstract = {Coupling 3-D hydrodynamics with climate models is necessary but difficult for resolving multiscale interactions and has been rarely implemented in predicting Great Lakes' water level fluctuations because of issues in treating net basin supply (NBS) components and connecting channel flows. This study developed an interactive lake-atmosphere-hydrology modeling system by coupling the regional Climate-Weather Research and Forecasting model (CWRF) with the 3-D unstructured-grid Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) in the Great Lakes region. The sensitivity of the coupled system, relative to the CWRF baseline using the 1-D Lake, Ice, Snow and Sediment Simulator (LISSS), was evaluated in representing lake-climate conditions during 1999–2015 against observations. As coupled with CWRF, FVCOM outperformed LISSS in simulating water surface temperature, ice cover, and vertical thermal structure at seasonal to interannual scales for all the five lakes and realistically reproduced the regional circulation patterns. In warm seasons, the improved lake conditions significantly corrected LISSS overestimates of surface air temperature together with larger-scale circulation changes. Consequently, precipitation was generally reduced over each lake basin, mainly because of decreased surface moisture and heat fluxes along with enhanced atmospheric stability. Through the dynamic coupling, FVCOM predicts the water level fluctuations in direct response to the CWRF NBS components and connecting channel flows based on a stage-fall-discharge formulation. This coupled CWRF-FVCOM reasonably captured the NBS variations and predicted the water level fluctuations for Lakes Superior and Michigan-Huron. It represents a major advance in interacting regional climate and watershed processes to dynamically predict Great Lakes' water level seasonal-interannual variations.},

abstract = {The present study is to apply the immersed-boundary method to simulate 2- and 3-D viscous incompressible flows interacting with moving solid boundaries. Previous studies indicated that for stationary-boundary problems, different treatments inside the solid body did not affect the external flow. However, the relationship between internal treatment of the solid body and external flow for moving-boundary problems was not studied extensively and is investigated here. This is achieved via direct-momentum forcing on a Cartesian grid by combining “solid-body forcing” at solid nodes and interpolation on neighboring fluid nodes. The influence of the solid body forcing within the solid nodes is first examined by computing flow induced by an oscillating cylinder in a stationary square domain, where significantly lower amplitude oscillations in computed lift and drag coefficients are obtained compared with those without solid-body-forcing strategy. Grid-function convergence tests also indicate second-order accuracy of this implementation with respect to the L1 norm in time and the L2 norm in space. Further test problems are simulated to examine the validity of the present technique: 2-D flows over an asymmetrically-placed cylinder in a channel, in-line oscillating cylinder in a fluid at rest, in-line oscillating cylinder in a free stream, two cylinders moving with respect to one another, and 3-D simulation of a sphere settling under gravity in a static fluid. All computed results are in generally good agreement with various experimental measurements and with previous numerical simulations. This indicates the capability of the present simple implementation in solving complex-geometry flow problems and the importance of solid body forcing in computing flows with moving solid objects.},

abstract = {The amplification of flood frequencies by sea level rise (SLR) is expected to become one of the most economically damaging impacts of climate change for many coastal locations. Understanding the magnitude and pattern by which the frequency of current flood levels increase is important for developing more resilient coastal settlements, particularly since flood risk management (e.g. infrastructure, insurance, communications) is often tied to estimates of flood return periods. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report characterized the multiplication factor by which the frequency of flooding of a given height increases (referred to here as an amplification factor; AF). However, this characterization neither rigorously considered uncertainty in SLR nor distinguished between the amplification of different flooding levels (such as the 10{\%} versus 0.2{\%} annual chance floods); therefore, it may be seriously misleading. Because both historical flood frequency and projected SLR are uncertain, we combine joint probability distributions of the two to calculate AFs and their uncertainties over time. Under probabilistic relative sea level projections, while maintaining storm frequency fixed, we estimate a median 40-fold increase (ranging from 1- to 1314-fold) in the expected annual number of local 100-year floods for tide-gauge locations along the contiguous US coastline by 2050. While some places can expect disproportionate amplification of higher frequency events and thus primarily a greater number of historically precedented floods, others face amplification of lower frequency events and thus a particularly fast growing risk of historically unprecedented flooding. For example, with 50 cm of SLR, the 10{\%}, 1{\%}, and 0.2{\%} annual chance floods are expected respectively to recur 108, 335, and 814 times as often in Seattle, but 148, 16, and 4 times as often in Charleston, SC.},

abstract = {A finite-volume formulation is presented that solves the three-dimensional, nonhydrostatic Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation on an unstructured, staggered, z-level grid, with the goal of simulating nonhydrostatic processes in the coastal ocean with grid resolutions of tens of meters. In particular, the code has been developed to simulate the nonlinear, nonhydrostatic internal wave field in the littoral ocean. The method is based on the formulation developed by Casulli, in that the free-surface and vertical diffusion are semi-implicit, thereby removing stability limitations associated with the surface gravity wave and vertical diffusion terms. The remaining terms in the momentum equations are discretized explicitly with the second-order Adams-Bashforth method, while the pressure-correction method is employed for the nonhydrostatic pressure in order to achieve overall second-order temporal accuracy. Advection of momentum is accomplished with an Eulerian discretization which conserves momentum in cells that do not contain the free surface, and scalar advection is discretized in a way that ensures consistency with continuity, thereby ensuring local and global mass conservation using a velocity field that conserves volume on a local and global basis. The nonhydrostatic pressure field is solved efficiently using a block-Jacobi preconditioner, and while stability is limited by the internal gravity wave speed and vertical advection of momentum, applications requiring relatively small time steps due to accuracy or stability constraints are run efficiently on parallel computers, since the present formulation is written entirely with the message-passing interface (MPI). The ParMETIS libraries are employed in order to achieve a load-balanced parallel partitioning that minimizes interprocessor communication, and the grid is reordered to optimize per-processor performance by limiting cache misses while accessing arrays in memory. Test cases demonstrate the ability of the code to efficiently and accurately compute the nonhydrostatic lock exchange and internal waves in idealized as well as real domains, and we evaluate the parallel efficiency of the code using up to 32 processors. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the last decades, the Niger Delta region has experienced rapid growth in population and economic activity with enormous benefits to the adjacent states and the entire Nigerian society. As the region embarks upon an unprecedented phase of economic expansion in the 21st century, it faces several environmental challenges fuelled partly by the pressures caused by human activities such as oil and gas exploration, housing development, and road construction for transportation, economic development and demographic changes. This continued growth has resulted in environmental problems such as coastal wetland loss, habitat degradation, and water pollution, gas flaring, destruction of forest vegetation as well as a host of other issues. This underscores the urgent need to design new approaches for managing remote costal resources in sensitive tropical environments effectively in order to maintain a balance between coastal resource conservation and rapid economic development in developing countries for sustainability. Notwithstanding previous initiatives, there have not been any major efforts in the literature to undertake a remote sensing and GIS based assessment of the growing incidence of environmental change within coastal zone environments of the study area. This project is an attempt to fill that void in the literature by exploring the applications of GIS and remote sensing in a tropical coastal zone environment with emphasis on the environmental impacts of development in the Niger Delta region of Southern Nigeria. To deal with some of the aforementioned issues, several research questions that are of great relevance to the paper have been posed. The questions include, Have there been any changes in the coastal environment of the study area? What are the impacts of the changes? What forces are responsible for the changes? Has there been any major framework in place to deal with the changes? The prime objective of the paper is to provide a novel approach for assessing the state of coastal environments while the second objective seeks a contribution to the literature. The third objective is to provide a decision support tool for coastal resource managers in the assessment of environmental impacts of development in tropical areas. The fourth objective is to assess the extent of change in a tropical ecosystem with the latest advances in geo-spatial information technologies and methods. In terms of methodology, the paper draws from primary and census data sources analyzed with descriptive statistics, GIS techniques and remote sensing. The sections in the paper consist of a review of the major environmental effects and factors associated with the problem: initiatives and mitigation measures. The project offers some recommendations as part of the conservation strategies. In spite of concerted efforts by managers to address the problems, results revel that the study area experienced some significant changes in its coastal environments. These changes are attributed to socio-economic and environmental variables.},

Validation of the model is presented, followed by physical-forcing and temporal assessments of inundation within the river-adjacent watershed basins. The model validation and inundation assessment demonstrates the need to apply watershed runoff as an additional boundary condition in order to more fully capture the peak surge and recession, which added {\~{}}0.5 m to storm tide elevation in the lower St. Johns River, extended the surge recession by nearly 5 days, and increased the inundated watershed area by almost 50{\%}.

Implementation of the approach requires careful definition of the SWAT-ADCIRC interfaces at tributaries and river offshoots, which for the case of the lower St. Johns River Basin was accomplished with 8 inflow boundary condition locations. Other details of the approach are discussed, and general guidance for application to other estuaries is provided.},

abstract = {This work documents the first version of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) new Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv1). We focus on the standard resolution of the fully coupled physical model designed to address DOE mission-relevant water cycle questions. Its components include atmosphere and land (110-km grid spacing), ocean and sea ice (60 km in the midlatitudes and 30 km at the equator and poles), and river transport (55 km) models. This base configuration will also serve as a foundation for additional configurations exploring higher horizontal resolution as well as augmented capabilities in the form of biogeochemistry and cryosphere configurations. The performance of E3SMv1 is evaluated by means of a standard set of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Characterization of Klima simulations consisting of a long preindustrial control, historical simulations (ensembles of fully coupled and prescribed SSTs) as well as idealized CO2 forcing simulations. The model performs well overall with biases typical of other CMIP-class models, although the simulated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is weaker than many CMIP-class models. While the E3SMv1 historical ensemble captures the bulk of the observed warming between preindustrial (1850) and present day, the trajectory of the warming diverges from observations in the second half of the twentieth century with a period of delayed warming followed by an excessive warming trend. Using a two-layer energy balance model, we attribute this divergence to the model's strong aerosol-related effective radiative forcing (ERFari+aci = −1.65 W/m2) and high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS = 5.3 K).},

The predictors of the MLR are specified to represent prolonged surface wind stress and a surface sea level pressure minimum for a boxed region near each station. The regression underpredicts relatively large (≥95th percentile) storm maximum surge heights by 6.0{\%}–38.0{\%}. A bias-correction technique reduces the average mean absolute error by 10{\%}–15{\%} at the various stations for storm maximum surge predictions.

In the VARANS equations, the volume-averaged Reynolds stress is modeled by adopting the nonlinear eddy viscosity assumption. The model equations for the volume-averaged turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate are derived by taking the volume-average of the standard k−ϵ equations. Because of the volume-averaging process, the effects of the small-scale turbulence in porous media are introduced. The performance of the model is checked by comparing numerical solutions with the experimental data related to a composite breakwater reported by Sakakiyama and Liu [Coast. Eng. 121 (2001) 117].},

abstract = {We apply several skill tests to assess tidal currents within a three-dimensional, eddy resolving, global ocean circulation model compared to over 5000 observational velocity records spanning 40 years. We examine the skill of the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) on a regional, basin, and global scale and in deep versus shallow water. On a global scale, we examine the model tidal kinetic energy (KE) compared to the tidal KE estimated from the observational velocity records. We examine the vertical structure of the model tidal KE by averaging over predetermined depth bins. We also investigate the ability of the model to satisfy the 95{\%} confidence intervals of the individual tidal ellipse parameters. On a basin scale, we determine if any bias exists in model performance with regards to a particular part of the global ocean and further investigate if any variability of model skill exists within the ocean basins by testing the model against smaller subsets of the observations. Our results show that the skill of the nondata assimilative HYCOM is comparable to the skill of the altimetric-constrained model TPXO7.2. HYCOM is shown to have up to 20{\%} higher skill in resolving the Greenwich phase of the tides on a global basis and demonstrates moderate skill in replicating the vertical structure of the tidal currents as represented by the current meters. HYCOM demonstrates up to 20{\%} higher skill than TPXO7.2 for some ocean basins and some ocean regions but exhibits up to 20{\%} weaker skill in the Southern Ocean.},

@article{Wei2019,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd Storm propagation speed (SPS) can noticeably impact coastal floods around semi-closed basins influenced by extratropical offshore storms. As a case study, the SPS impact on potential flood hazards due to extreme water levels along the UK east coast was studied using a numerical shelf sea model (FVCOM). The storm Xaver, which caused the largest North Sea surge over the past 60 years, was studied as a base scenario. Halving/doubling the SPS results in a smaller surge and a longer/shorter surge duration. Hence, the largest peak water level was found at actual speed, while the largest potential flood hazard occurred at half speed. Tide–surge interaction tends to reduce the M2 tide along the coast and advance its propagation for all SPS. A three-dimensional semi-analytical model, including a time-periodic wind forcing, was used to investigate the dominant mechanisms behind the surge dynamics, where wind duration is directly related to the SPS. Long wind durations correspond to small SPS, and vice versa. The semi-analytical model was applied to the North Sea. The model reproduces the spatial features of the North Sea surge and its dependence on SPS, confirming the surge induced by offshore storms is primarily associated with wind set-up. Model results suggest the SPS of Xaver is likely to have contributed greatly to the occurrence of the largest North Sea surge due to wind-generated resonance. The impact of the SPS on the surge and tide–surge interaction are of great importance to coastal flood hazard assessment.},

abstract = {[1] Numerical simulations of the Hudson River estuary using a terrain-following, three-dimensional model ( Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS)) are compared with an extensive set of time series and spatially resolved measurements over a 43 day period with large variations in tidal forcing and river discharge. The model is particularly effective at reproducing the observed temporal variations in both the salinity and current structure, including tidal, spring neap, and river discharge - induced variability. Large observed variations in stratification between neap and spring tides are captured qualitatively and quantitatively by the model. The observed structure and variations of the longitudinal salinity gradient are also well reproduced. The most notable discrepancy between the model and the data is in the vertical salinity structure. While the surface-to-bottom salinity difference is well reproduced, the stratification in the model tends to extend all the way to the water surface, whereas the observations indicate a distinct pycnocline and a surface mixed layer. Because the southern boundary condition is located near the mouth the estuary, the salinity within the domain is particularly sensitive to the specification of salinity at the boundary. A boundary condition for the horizontal salinity gradient, based on the local value of salinity, is developed to incorporate physical processes beyond the open boundary not resolved by the model. Model results are sensitive to the specification of the bottom roughness length and vertical stability functions, insofar as they influence the intensity of vertical mixing. The results only varied slightly between different turbulence closure methods of k-{\&}epsilon;, k-{\&}omega;, and k-kl.},

abstract = {Accurate representations of lake-ice-atmosphere interactions in regional climatemodeling remain one of themost critical and unresolved issues for understanding large-lake ecosystems and their watersheds. To date, the representation of theGreat Lakes two-way interactions in regional climatemodels is achieved with one-dimensional (1D) lake models applied at the atmospheric model lake grid points distributed spatially across a 2D domain. While some progress has beenmade in refining 1D lake model processes, such models are fundamentally incapable of realistically resolving a number of physical processes in the Great Lakes. In this study, a two-way coupled 3D lake-ice-climate modeling system [Great Lakes-Atmosphere Regional Model (GLARM)] is developed to improve the simulation of large lakes in regional climate models and accurately resolve the hydroclimatic interactions. Model results are compared to a wide variety of observational data and demonstrate the unique skill of the coupled 3D modeling system in reproducing trends and variability in the Great Lakes regional climate, as well as in capturing the physical characteristics of the Great Lakes by fully resolving the lake hydrodynamics. Simulations of the climatology and spatiotemporal variability of lake thermal structure and ice are significantly improved over previous coupled, 1D simulations. At seasonal and annual time scales, differences inmodel results are primarily observed for variables that are directly affected by lake surface temperature (e.g., evaporation, precipitation, sensible heat flux) while no significant differences are found in other atmospheric variables (e.g., solar radiation, cloud cover). Underlying physical mechanisms for the simulation improvements using GLARM are also discussed.},

abstract = {The validity and accuracy of approaches used to determine hurricane surge hazard risk received much attention following the hurricane seasons in mid- to late-2000, which caused record surge-related damage along the Gulf of Mexico coastline. Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, research showed that most extreme-value statistics approaches underestimated the risk associated with this surge event. In this paper, two of the most popular methods for determining hurricane surge extreme-value statistics are reviewed: the historical surge population approach and the joint probability method. Here, it is demonstrated that both limited historical record length and random along-coast variability in hurricane landfall location can introduce significant errors into surge estimates. For example, the historical surge population approach gives errors of 9{\%} to 17{\%} for return periods between 50 and 1000 years when a surge record of 100 years is considered. In contrast, it is shown that the joint probability method yields significantly more reliable surge estimates, with errors of 2{\%} to 3{\%} for return periods between 50 and 1000 years when a storm record of 100 years is considered. Finally, we show that both methods remain robust when decadal-scale climate variability in the storm rate of occurrence is considered, so long as the hurricane history is long enough to capture the full decadal cycle. When used in conjunction with continuous surge response information, it can be concluded that the joint probability method is a practical and reliable approach for determining extreme-value hurricane surge statistics.

A numerical model based on N-S equations and Volume Of Fluids (VOF) method is employed. Comparisons of elevation, velocity and shear stress are made among the four turbulence models against experimental data of wave run-up on a mild slope beach. It is found that before wave breaking on the slope, the outputs of the four different turbulence models agree reasonably well with each other. This suggests that during the run-up process the turbulence effect is negligible before wave breaking. Moreover, in the wave breaking zone, both the standard k-ɛ model and the high-Reynolds-number k-$\omega$ model predict the mean velocity field quite well, but generally under-predict the velocity and turbulent kinetic energy using wall functions on the solid slope surface.},

Twenty-six gravity modes were found with periods greater than 8 h, the slowest being a fundamental mode of about 67 h. The North Atlantic co-oscillates with the South Atlantic at a period of about 42 h, and has strong resonances at 23, 21, 14.4, 12.8, 8.6 and 8.3 h. Eleven topographically-induced modes of rotational type were found with periods less than 100 h; the fastest of these is a 44 h mode in the Weddell Sea. In the 6° model the fastest rotational mode of the North Atlantic is a 55 h topographic wave most prominent near the Grand Banks of Newfoundland.},

@article{Kossin2018,
abstract = {As the Earth's atmosphere warms, the atmospheric circulation changes. These changes vary by region and time of year, but there is evidence that anthropogenic warming causes a general weakening of summertime tropical circulation 1-8 . Because tropical cyclones are carried along within their ambient environmental wind, there is a plausible a priori expectation that the translation speed of tropical cyclones has slowed with warming. In addition to circulation changes, anthropogenic warming causes increases in atmospheric water-vapour capacity, which are generally expected to increase precipitation rates 9 . Rain rates near the centres of tropical cyclones are also expected to increase with increasing global temperatures 10-12 . The amount of tropical-cyclone-related rainfall that any given local area will experience is proportional to the rain rates and inversely proportional to the translation speeds of tropical cyclones. Here I show that tropical-cyclone translation speed has decreased globally by 10 per cent over the period 1949-2016, which is very likely to have compounded, and possibly dominated, any increases in local rainfall totals that may have occurred as a result of increased tropical-cyclone rain rates. The magnitude of the slowdown varies substantially by region and by latitude, but is generally consistent with expected changes in atmospheric circulation forced by anthropogenic emissions. Of particular importance is the slowdown of 30 per cent and 20 per cent over land areas affected by western North Pacific and North Atlantic tropical cyclones, respectively, and the slowdown of 19 per cent over land areas in the Australian region. The unprecedented rainfall totals associated with the 'stall' of Hurricane Harvey 13-15 over Texas in 2017 provide a notable example of the relationship between regional rainfall amounts and tropical-cyclone translation speed. Any systematic past or future change in the translation speed of tropical cyclones, particularly over land, is therefore highly relevant when considering potential changes in local rainfall totals.},

abstract = {A new model for the M2, S2, K1, and O1 tides in the Weddell Sea is developed by assimilating CryoSat-2 data into a barotropic tide model. A variational approach is used, which explicitly allows for errors in the water depth, that is, the bottom topography in open water and the water column thickness under floating ice shelves, so that an optimized estimate of the topography is obtained together with the tidal fields. In preparation for assimilation, the sensitivity of the tidal elevation to the interfacial drag at the sea floor and the ice-water interface (under the floating ice shelves) is investigated; this motivates the development of a new drag parameterization which is more accurate and physically plausible in comparison with the interfacial drag alone. The assimilation of CryoSat-2 data into the model results in tidal elevations with essentially the same accuracy as previous estimates, which is demonstrated by comparisons with independent in situ data and withheld CryoSat-2 data. The novelty of the present tidal estimates is that they are consistent with well-defined dynamics based on the Laplace Tidal Equations—augmented with the new parameterization of drag—and modifications of the prior estimate of underwater topography and water column thickness. Analysis of the sensitivity to the topography finds that, at this level of precision, the topography is not uniquely determined by the observed data.},

abstract = {This is a study of the fundamental physical processes of the runup of long waves with the objective to understand some coastal effects of tsunamis. The runup of nonbreaking long waves on plane beaches is studied and an exact solution is developed for the runup of solitary waves. The maximum runup predicted by this solution is compared to laboratory data from this and other investigations and it is found to be in good agreement. A runup transducer was developed and deployed in the laboratory to provide data for the shape of the runup tongue. The exact solution is shown to model the details of the climb of the wave satisfactorily. The runup of breaking long waves on plane beaches is investigated in the laboratory by studying different long waves and bores of finite volume. The runup is shown to be a function of a momentum scale determined from the generation characteristics of the incoming wave. The runup number is introduced and it is demonstrated that it models the runup process adequately. It is also observed that arbitrary long waves have runup numbers smaller than, or at most equal to, the runup number of breaking solitary waves, suggesting that on a given plane beach breaking solitary waves run-up further than other long waves with similar generation characteristics. An exact result is established for the force on an accelerating plate in a fluid with a free surface. The result is used to explain some of the results of this study and other results on the hydrodynamic forces on moving partitions. A technique is developed to generate arbitrary, long, continuously evolving waves at any desired location in a laboratory model. The technique is applied in the laboratory and it is shown to be successful in reproducing complex waveforms.},

abstract = {Storm surges are responsible for much of the damage and loss of life associated with landfalling hurricanes. Understanding how global warming will affect hurricane surges thus holds great interest. As general circulation models (GCMs) cannot simulate hurricane surges directly, we couple a GCM-driven hurricane model with hydrodynamic models to simulate large numbers of synthetic surge events under projected climates and assess surge threat, as an example, for New York City (NYC). Struck by many intense hurricanes in recorded history and prehistory, NYC is highly vulnerable to storm surges. We show that the change of storm climatology will probably increase the surge risk for NYC; results based on two GCMs show the distribution of surge levels shifting to higher values by a magnitude comparable to the projected sea-level rise (SLR). The combined effects of storm climatology change and a 1m SLR may cause the present NYC 100-yr surge flooding to occur every 3-20yr and the present 500-yr flooding to occur every 25-240yr by the end of the century. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

@article{Taylor2001,
abstract = {It is proposed that the sea surface roughness zo can be predicted from the height and steepness of the waves, zo/Hs = A(Hs/Lp)B, where Hs and Lp are the significant wave height and peak wavelength for the combined sea and swell spectrum; best estimates for the coefficients are A = 1200, B = 4.5. The proposed formula is shown to predict well the magnitude and behavior of the drag coefficient as observed in wave tanks, lakes, and the open ocean, thus reconciling observations that previously had appeared disparate. Indeed, the formula suggests that changes in roughness due to limited duration or fetch are of order 10{\%} or less. Thus all deep water, pure windseas, regardless of fetch or duration, extract momentum from the air at a rate similar to that predicted for a fully developed sea. This is confirmed using published field data for a wide range of conditions over lakes and coastal seas. Only for field data corresponding to extremely young waves (U10/cp {\textgreater} 3) were there appreciable differences between the predicted and observed roughness values, the latter being larger on average. Significant changes in roughness may be caused by shoaling or by swell. A large increase in roughness is predicted for shoaling waves if the depth is less than about 0.2Lp. The presence of swell in the open ocean acts, on average, to significantly decrease the effective wave steepness and hence the mean roughness compared to that for a pure windsea. Thus the predicted open ocean roughness is, at most wind speeds, significantly less than is observed for pure wind waves on lakes. Only at high wind speeds, such that the windsea dominates the swell, do the mean open ocean values reach those for a fully developed sea.},

abstract = {The effect of ocean self-attraction and loading (SAL) is considered in a global, barotropic ocean model forced by atmospheric wind stress, atmospheric pressure, and tidal forcing. Periods shorter than 7 days are considered. The model is integrated with a proper calculation of these effects in terms of a (very expensive) Green's function convolution at each time step. SAL effects produce a perturbation of typically about 10{\%} of the computed ocean bottom pressure, but much more in places, for both tidal and atmospherically forced motions. An investigation into simple parameterizations of these effects by means of a term proportional to local bottom pressure reveals the following results: For tides, the best coefficient is systematically dependent on depth, ranging from less than 0.08 in shallow water to about 0.12 in the deepest water, and incorporating this effect improves the parameterization. For atmospherically forced motions, there is still some effect of depth but more an effect of latitude (increasingly so for longer periods), regional variation is greater, and correlation between the SAL effect and bottom pressure is weaker. Parameterization with a constant coefficient of 0.1 reduces errors due to failing to include SAL by about 30{\%}. To do better than this, a proper scale-dependent representation of SAL must be used.

Stability is shown to require non-zero friction as well as satisfaction of a Courant constraint. Lumping is shown to reduce the Courant constraint for stability while higher order and quadratic finite element approximations require a more restrictive constraint than their second order and linear finite element counterparts. The amplitude of the propagation factor for stable schemes and propagating waves is seen to be independent of the Courant number and type of numerical approximation. Although the higher order and quadratic schemes provide better propagation of the low and moderate frequency waves, the highest frequency waves (2$\Delta$x) are better propagated by low order numerical methods. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

The law of the wall and the velocity defect law were re‐examined because the log‐law has been often applied to open channels without detailed verification. It was found that the log‐law can be applied strictly only to the near‐wall region. In this region, the von K´rm´n constant $\kappa$ and the integral constant A are truly universal, having values of $\kappa$=0.412 and A=5.29 irrespective of the Reynolds and Froude number. As the Reynolds number becomes larger, the deviation from the log‐law cannot be neglected in the outer region. This deviation can be expressed well by Coles' wake function which involves a Reynolds‐number dependent parameter $\Pi$. The distributions of eddy viscosity and mixing length were evaluated and found to depend on $\Pi$. All the data including the...},

abstract = {A non-iterative method for handling the coupling of the implicitly discretised time-dependent fluid flow equations is described. The method is based on the use of pressure and velocity as dependent variables and is hence applicable to both the compressible and incompressible versions of the transport equations. The main feature of the technique is the splitting of the solution process into a series of steps whereby operations on pressure are decoupled from those on velocity at each step, with the split sets of equations being amenable to solution by standard techniques. At each time-step, the procedure yields solutions which approximate the exact solution of the difference equations. The accuracy of this splitting procedure is assessed for a linearised form of the discretised equations, and the analysis indicates that the solution yielded by it differs from the exact solution of the difference equations by terms proportional to the powers of the time-step size. By virtue of this, it is possible to dispense with iteration, thus resulting in an efficient implicit scheme while retaining simplicity of implementation relative to contemporary block simultaneous methods. This is verified in a companion paper which presents results of computations carried out using the method.},

Previous studies have found that the SLOSH model estimates storm surges with an accuracy of ±20{\%}. In this study, through hindcasts of historical storms, we assess the accuracy of the SLOSH model for four coastal regions in the Northeastern United States. We investigate the potential to improve this accuracy through modification of the wind field representation. We modify the surface background wind field, the parametric wind profile, and the maximum wind speed based on empirical, physical, and observational data. We find that on average the SLOSH model underestimates maximum storm surge heights by 22{\%}. The modifications to the surface background wind field and the parametric wind profile have minor impacts; however, the effect of the modification to maximum wind speed is significant-it increases the variance in the SLOSH model estimates of maximum storm surges, but improves its accuracy overall. We recommend that observed values of maximum wind speed be used in SLOSH model simulations when possible.},

The approach adopted uses information readily available from hurricane archives or in hurricane warning information and the profile can be readily incorporated into existing parametric models of the hurricane surface wind field. The original model utilized central and environmental surface pressures, maximum winds, and radius of maximum winds. In the revision a capacity to incorporate additional wind observations at some radius within the hurricane circulation was included. If surface observations are used, then a surface wind profile will result, obviating the need for deriving a boundary layer reduction from the gradient wind level. The model has considerably less sensitivity to data errors compared to the original and is shown to reproduce hurricane reconnaissance and surface wind profiles with high accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The 2004 Great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake had an average source duration of about 500 sec. and a rupture length of 1,200–1,300 km. The seismic moment, M0, determined with a finite source model, was 6.5×1022 N-m, which corresponds to Mw=9.18. Allowing for the uncertainties in the current M0 determinations, Mw is in the range of 9.1 to 9.3. The tsunami magnitude Mt is 9.1, suggesting that the overall size of the tsunami is consistent with what is expected of an earthquake with Mw=9.1 to 9.3. The short-period body-wave magnitude m-hatb is 7.25, which is considerably smaller than that of large earthquakes with a comparable Mw. The m-hatb versus Mw relationship indicates that, overall, the Great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake is not a tsunami earthquake. The tectonic environment of the rupture zone of the Great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake is very different from that of other great earthquakes, such as the 1960 Chile and the 1964 Alaska earthquakes. This difference may be responsible for the unique source characteristics of this earthquake. The extremely large size of the Great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake is reflected in the large amplitude of the long-period phase, the W phase, even in the early part of the seismograms before the arrival of the S wave. This information could be used for various early warning purposes.},

abstract = {The resonance of semi-diurnal tidal elevations is investigated with a forward numerical forced damped global tide model and an analytical model of forced-damped tides in a deep ocean basin coupled to a shelf. The analytical model contains the classical half-wavelength and quarter-wavelength resonances in the deep ocean and shelf, respectively, as well as a forcing-scale dependence which depends on the ratio of the phase speed of open-ocean gravity waves to that of the astronomical forcing. In the analytical model, when the deep ocean and shelf resonate separately at the same frequency, the resonance in the coupled system shifts to frequencies slightly higher and lower than the original frequency, such that a 'double bump' is seen in plots of elevation amplitude versus frequency. The addition of a shelf to a resonant open ocean tends to reduce open-ocean tides, especially when the shelf is also near resonance. The magnitude of this 'back-effect' is controlled by shelf friction. A weakly damped resonant shelf has a larger back-effect on the open-ocean tide than does a strongly damped shelf. Numerical simulations largely bear out the analytical model predictions, at least qualitatively. Idealized simulations show that continents enhance tides by enabling the half-wavelength resonance. Simulations with realistic geometry and topography but varying longitudinal structure in the astronomical forcing display an influence of the forcing scale on tidal amplitudes somewhat similar to that seen in the analytical model. A frequency sweep in the semi-diurnal band in experiments with realistic geometry and topography reveals weakly resonant peaks in the amplitudes of several shelf regions and in the globally averaged open-ocean amplitudes. Finally, the back-effect of the shelf upon the open ocean is seen in simulations in which locations of resonant coastal tides are blocked out and open-ocean tidal elevations are significantly altered (increased, generally) as a result.},

abstract = {The field of mesh generation concerns the development of efficient algorithmic techniques to construct high-quality tessellations of complex geometrical objects. In this thesis, I investigate the problem of unstructured simplicial mesh generation for problems in R2 and R3, in which meshes consist of collections of triangular and tetrahedral elements. I focus on the development of efficient algorithms and computer programs to produce high-quality meshes for planar, surface and volumetric objects of arbitrary complexity. I develop and implement a number of new algorithms for mesh construction based on the Frontal-Delaunay paradigm – a hybridisation of conventional Delaunay-refinement and advancing-front techniques. I show that the proposed algorithms are a significant im- provement on existing approaches, typically outperforming theDelaunay-refinement tech- nique in terms of element shape- and size-quality, while offering significantly improved theoretical robustness compared to advancing-front techniques. I verify experimentally that the proposed methods achieve the same theoretical element shape- and size-bounds typically associated with conventional Delaunay-refinement techniques. An implemen- tation of the new Frontal-Delaunay algorithms, in addition to conventional Delaunay- refinement techniques, are provided in the new mesh generation package JIGSAW. In addition to mesh construction, methods for mesh improvement are also investigated. I develop and implement a family of techniques to improve the element shape quality of existing simplicial meshes, using a combination of optimisation-based vertex smoothing, local topological transformation and vertex insertion. These operations are interleaved according to a new priority-based schedule, and I show that the resulting algorithms are competitive with existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of mesh quality, while offering significant improvements in computational efficiency. An implementation of the suite of new mesh optimisation algorithms for the improvement of planar, surface and volumetric meshes are provided in the JITTERBUG package.},

abstract = {While global climate models (GCMs) provide useful projections of near-surface wind vectors into the 21st century, resolution is not sufficient enough for use in regional wave modeling. Statistically downscaled GCM projections from Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogues provide daily averaged near-surface winds at an appropriate spatial resolution for wave modeling within the orographically complex region of San Francisco Bay, but greater resolution in time is needed to capture the peak of storm events. Short-duration high wind speeds, on the order of hours, are usually excluded in statistically downscaled climate models and are of key importance in wave and subsequent coastal flood modeling. Here we present a temporal downscaling approach, similar to constructed analogues, for near-surface winds suitable for use in local wave models and evaluate changes in wind and wave conditions for the 21st century. Reconstructed hindcast winds (1975–2004) recreate important extreme wind values within San Francisco Bay. A computationally efficient method for simulating wave heights over long time periods was used to screen for extreme events. Wave hindcasts show resultant maximum wave heights of 2.2 m possible within the Bay. Changes in extreme over-water wind speeds suggest contrasting trends within the different regions of San Francisco Bay, but 21th century projections show little change in the overall magnitude of extreme winds and locally generated waves.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates the capability of a new state-of-the-art flood modelling system consisting of multiple nested models to simulate urban coastal flood inundation. A flood event in Cork City, Ireland which occurred in November 2009 is analysed in detail. The new flood modelling system comprises of two dynamically linked models: an ocean model (POM) of the northeast Atlantic (ca. 5 km grid) and a coastal flood model, MSN{\_}Flood, which resolves the hydrodynamics of Cork Harbour and its sub region at four spatial scales 90 m, 30 m, 6 m and 2 m through a cascade of four nested grids. Flood water propagation through Cork City floodplains is simulated by the 2 m grid model. The POM-MSN{\_}Flood modelling system, presented for the first time in this paper, was used to investigate the dynamics of coastal flooding resulting from a complex set of tides, storm surges, rivers inflows and the interactions between them. Unlike many flood models, the modelling system used in this research provides a full description of water levels and flow regimes, both in coastal waters and urban floodplains. Validation results clearly demonstrate that the model is capable of resolving hydrodynamics at scales commensurate with flow features including the large scale processes of the NE Atlantic Ocean and the fine resolution circulation of coastal waters. With regards to urban flooding, the model was found to accurately determine flood wave propagation patterns, flood wave heights, speeds and inundation extents. Ultimately, the model was used to investigate mechanisms of flooding resulting from multiple process drivers and to assess flood risk to human safety. Such an analysis facilitates better understating of the mechanics and dynamics of complex coastal urban flooding and would therefore be of interest in the field of coastal management.},

@article{Shakespeare2020,
abstract = {The generation of internal waves at abyssal hills has been proposed as an important source of bottom-intensified mixing and a sink of geostrophic momentum. Using the theory of Bell, previous authors have calculated either the generation of lee waves by geostrophic flow or the generation of the internal tide by the barotropic tide, but never both together. However, the Bell theory shows that the two are interdependent: that is, the presence of a barotropic tide modifies the generation of lee waves, and the presence of a geo-strophic (time mean) flow modifies the generation of the internal tide. Here we extend the theory of Bell to incorporate multiple tidal constituents. Using this extended theory, we recalculate global wave fluxes of energy and momentum using the abyssal-hill spectra, model-derived abyssal ocean stratification and geo-strophic flow estimates, and the TPX08 tidal velocities for the eight major constituents. The energy flux into lee waves is suppressed by 13{\%}–19{\%} as a result of the inclusion of tides. The generated wave flux is dominated by the principal lunar semidiurnal tide (M2), and its harmonics and combinations, with the strongest fluxes occurring along midocean ridges. The internal tide generation is strongly asymmetric because of Doppler shifting by the geostrophic abyssal flow, with 55{\%}–63{\%} of the wave energy flux (and stress) directed upstream, against the geostrophic flow. As a consequence, there is a net wave stress associated with generation of the internal tide that reaches magnitudes of 0.01–0.1 N m22 in the vicinity of midocean ridges.},

In this study, a numerical code based on Nwogu's equations is developed. The model uses a fourth-order predictor-corrector method to advance in time, and discretizes first-order spatial derivatives to fourth-order accuracy, thus reducing all truncation errors to a level smaller than the dispersive terms retained by the model. The basic numerical scheme and associated boundary conditions are described. The model is applied to several examples of wave propagation in variable depth, and computed solutions are compared with experimental data. These initial results indicate that the model is capable of simulating wave transformation from relatively deep water to shallow water, giving accurate predictions of the height and shape of shoaled waves in both regular and ...},

Wave breaking is modeled by locally switching to the nonlinear shallow water equations when the Froude number exceeds a certain threshold. The moving shoreline boundary condition is implemented using the wetting–drying algorithm with the adjusted wave speed of the Riemann solver.

abstract = {This study focuses on understanding the evolution of Hurricane Earl (2010) with respect to random perturbations in the storm's initial strength, size, and asymmetry in wind distribution. We rely on the Unified Wave Interface-Coupled Model (UWIN-CM), a fully coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean system to generate a storm realization ensemble, and use polynomial chaos (PC) expansions to build surrogate models for time evolution of both the maximum wind speed and minimum sea level pressure in Earl. The resulting PC surrogate models provide statistical insights on probability distributions of model responses throughout the simulation time span. Statistical analysis of rapid intensification (RI) suggests that initial perturbations having intensified and counterclockwise-rotated winds are more likely to undergo RI. In addition, for the range of initial conditions considered RI seems mostly sensitive to azimuthally averaged maximum wind speed and asymmetry orientation, rather than storm size and asymmetry magnitude; this is consistent with global sensitivity analysis of PC surrogate models. Finally, we combine initial condition perturbations with a stochastic kinetic energy backscatter scheme (SKEBS) forcing in the UWIN-CM simulations and conclude that the storm tracks are substantially influenced by the SKEBS forcing perturbations, whereas the perturbations in initial conditions alone had only limited impact on the storm-track forecast.},

A matched filter approach between normalized simulated and measured DDMs is then applied to retrieve storm parameters. Because the method uses normalized DDMs in the retrieval, it is insensitive to the absolute power calibration of the DDM and instead relies on the DDM shape. Results from the method are shown for CYGNSS full DDM overpasses of Hurricane Irma as a case study.

Competent grain size is the largest grain size a flow is capable of mobilizing. Competent and observed grain sizes have similar broad spatial distributions. Coarser observed grain sizes are found in regions of larger stress, and associated coarser competent grain sizes and finer observed sizes are found in regions with finer competent sizes.

A series of laboratory experiments is presented to describe the amplitude evolution of long waves; these experiments suggest that at least four different regions exist for the functional variation of the maximum amplitude, two regions before and two regions after breaking. Linear theory is used to provide an expression for the growth of solitary waves evolving first over constant depth and then over a sloping bottom, including reflection. This result is shown to be equivalent to the wave evolution expression known as Green's law, and the limitations of Green's original derivation are discussed. Other existing analytical results and certain empirical relationships are used to produce a formulation consistent with the laboratory data with the objective to model the entire process of solitary wave evolution.},

Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing damages that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors - agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor - increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2{\%} of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20{\%} of county income (90{\%} chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).},

abstract = {Small islands in the vicinity of the mainland are widely believed to offer protection from wind and waves and thus coastal communities have been developed in mainland areas behind small islands. However, whether they offer protection from tsunamis is unclear. Do islands act as natural barriers? Recent post-tsunami survey data, supported by numerical simulations, reveal that the run-up on coastal areas behind small islands was significantly higher than on neighbouring locations not affected by the presence of the islands. To study the conditions of this run-up amplification, we solve numerically the nonlinear shallow water equations. We use the simplified geometry of a conical island sitting on a flat seafloor in front of a uniform sloping beach. By doing so, the experimental set-up is defined by five physical parameters, namely the island slope, the beach slope, the water depth, the distance between the island and the plane beach and the incoming wavelength, while the wave height was kept fixed. The objective is to find the maximum run-up amplification with the least number of simulations. To achieve this goal, we build an emulator based on Gaussian Processes to guide the selection of the query points in the parameter space. We thus reduce substantially the computations required to identify the run-up amplification. Our results show that the island acts as a focusing lens for energy and amplifies the run-up along the coastline behind its lee side, instead of protecting it, as popular beliefs suggest.},

Currents, temperature, and salinity were sampled over the upper 500 m for 20 months between December 2013 and August 2015. One of the major goals is to understand the space–time scales of the currents and physical processes that contribute to the exchange of water between the BoB and the Arabian Sea. The observations captured Southwest and Northeast Monsoon Currents, seasonally varying large eddies including a cyclonic eddy, the Sri Lanka dome (SLD), and an anticyclonic eddy southeast of the SLD. The observations further showed intraseasonal oscillations with periods of 30–70 days, near-inertial currents, and tides. Monthly averaged velocities commonly exceeded 50 cm s−1 near the surface, and extreme velocities exceeded 150 cm s−1 during the southwest monsoon. Ti...},

We used the immersed boundary method, which involves application of immersed boundary forces at solid boundaries rather than conventional boundary conditions, to investigate wave interactions with coastal structures in a three-dimensional numerical wave tank by solving the Navier–Stokes equations for two-phase flows. We simulated the run-up of a solitary wave around a circular island. Maximum run-up heights were computed around the island and compared with available laboratory measurements and previous numerical results. The three-dimensional features of the run-up process were analyzed in detail and compared with those of depth-integrated equations models.},

abstract = {A statistical procedure for estimating the risk of strong winds from hurricanes, known as the Hurricane Risk Calculator, is demonstrated and applied to several major cities in Louisiana. The procedure provides an estimate of wind risk over different length periods and can be applied to any location experiencing this hazard. Results show that an area 100 km around the city of New Orleans can expect to see hurricane winds blowing at 49 ms-1 (44.3-53.7) [90 {\%} confidence interval (CI)] or stronger, on average, once every 20 years. In comparison, for the same time period, the capital city of Baton Rouge and the surrounding area can expect to see hurricane winds of 43 ms-1 (38.2-47.8) (90 {\%} CI) or stronger. Hurricane track direction is also analyzed at the cities of interest. For Morgan City, Lafayette, Lake Charles, and Alexandria, tropical cyclones with winds at least 18 ms-1 travel from the southeast to northwest. New Orleans and Baton Rouge tropical cyclones have a greater tendency to turn toward the east while within 100 km of the city, historically giving them a southwesterly approach. Tropical cyclones within 350 km off the south-central Louisiana coast occur most often in September, and the most extreme of these events are becoming stronger through time as shown with quantile regression. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The fundamental purpose of the coupling effort is to develop the capability to seamlessly model tsunami evolution from generation to inundation with fine scale resolution, without the loss of locally important physics. The two model components are briefly introduced, and the physical mismatch between the two models is examined analytically. As coupling of numerically and physically heterogeneous models may result in undesirable errors, a general benchmark test has been undertaken to provide a parameter range for expected accuracy and stability. Long wave propagation onto a shallow shelf is simulated to validate the coupled model, examining the importance of dispersive and nonlinear effects in the nearshore area, as well as the utility of the coupled modeling system. Finally, the model is applied to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. In this test, the local dynamics experienced in the Port of Salalah in Oman, as documented by Okal et al. (2006), are recreated.},

The motivation for the study presented in this publication is to implement and optimize a model configuration that will satisfy this prerequisite in the frame of a larger objective in order to study the sediment dynamics and fate from the Red River Delta to the Gulf of Tonkin from a numerical hydrodynamical-sediment coupled model. Therefore, we focus on the main tidal constituents to conduct sensitivity experiments on the bathymetry and bottom friction parameterization. The frequency-domain solver available in the hydrodynamic unstructured grid model T-UGOm has been used to reduce the computational cost and allow for wider parameter explorations. Tidal solutions obtained from the optimal configuration were evaluated from tide measurements derived from satellite altimetry and tide gauges; the use of an improved bathymetry dataset and fine friction parameter adjustment significantly improved our tidal solutions. However, our experiments seem to indicate that the solution error budget is still dominated by bathymetry errors, which is the most common limitation for accurate tidal modeling.},

abstract = {Unstructured meshes are common in coastal modeling, but still rarely used for modeling the large-scale ocean circulation. Existing and new projects aim at changing this situation by proposing models enabling a regional focus (multiresolution) in global setups, without nesting and open boundaries. Among them, finite-volume models using the C-grid discretization on Voronoi-centroidal meshes or cell-vertex quasi-B-grid discretization on triangular meshes work well and offer the multiresolution functionality at a price of being 2 to 4 times slower per degree of freedom than structured-mesh models. This is already sufficient for many practical tasks and will be further improved as the number of vertical layers is increased. Approaches based on the finite-element method, both used or proposed, are as a rule slower at present. Most of staggered discretizations on triangular or Voronoi meshes allow spurious modes which are difficult to filter on unstructured meshes. The ongoing research seeks how to handle them and explores new approaches where such modes are absent. Issues of numerical efficiency and accurate transport schemes are still important, and the question on parameterizations for multiresolution meshes is hardly explored at all. The review summarizes recent developments the main practical result of which is the emergence of multiresolution models for simulating large-scale ocean circulation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Estuaries are potentially exposed to compound flooding where weather-driven extreme sea levels can occur synchronously with extreme fluvial discharge to amplify the hazard. The likelihood of compound flooding is difficult to determine due to multiple interacting physical processes operating at sub-daily scales, and poor observation records within estuaries with which to determine potential future probabilistic scenarios. We hypothesize that fluvial extremes can occur within the peak of the surge in small/steep catchments because of rapid runoff times, whilst the length-scale in larger/flatter catchments will result in fluvial and marine extremes being out-of-phase. Data (15 min river flow and hourly sea level) spanning 40 years were analyzed to assesses the behaviour and timings of fluvial and sea level extremes in two contrasting estuaries: Humber and Dyfi (United Kingdom). Compound events were common in the Dyfi, a small/steep catchment on Britain's west coast with fast fluvial response times. Almost half of the 937 skew-surge events (95th-percentile) occurred within a few hours of an extreme fluvial peak, suggesting that flood risk is sensitive to the storm timing relative to high tide—especially since flows persisted above the 95th-percentile typically for less than 12 h. Compound events were more frequent during autumn/winter than spring/summer. For the Humber, a larger/flatter catchment on the east coast with slower fluvial response times, extreme fluvial and skew-surge peaks were less frequent (half as many as the Dyfi) and compound events were less common (15{\%} of events co-occurred). Although flows in the Humber persisted above the 95th-percentile for typically between one and 4 days, hence overlapping several high tides and possibly other surges. Analysis of 56 flooding events across both estuaries revealed: 1) flooding is more common in the Dyfi than Humber; 2) Dyfi flooding is driven by 99th-percentile flows lasting hours and co-occurring with a 95th percentile skew-surge; 3) Humber flooding was driven by 95th-percentile flows lasting days, or surge-driven—but rarely co-occurring. Our results suggest that compound flooding studies require at least hourly data (previous analyses have often used daily-means), especially for smaller systems and considering the potential intensification of rainfall patterns into the future.},

Characteristics of waves are computed at and beyond the breaking point, and geometric self-similarities of breakers are discussed as a function of wave height and bottom slope. No wave breaks for slopes steeper than 12°. A breaking criterion is derived for milder slopes, based on values of a nondimensional slope parameter So. This criterion predicts both whether waves will break or not and which type of breaking will occur (spilling, plunging, or surging). Empirical expressions for the breaking index and for the depth and celerity at breaking are derived based on computations. All results agree well with laboratory experiments. The nonlinear shallow water equations fail to predict these results with sufficient accuracy at the breaking point. Prebreaking shoaling rates follow a more complex path than previously realized.

@article{Sherwood2014,
abstract = {Equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the ultimate change in global mean temperature in response to a change in external forcing. Despite decades of research attempting to narrow uncertainties, equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates from climate models still span roughly 1.5 to 5 degrees Celsius for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, precluding accurate projections of future climate. The spread arises largely from differences in the feedback from low clouds, for reasons not yet understood. Here we show that differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity estimated by 43 climate models. The apparent mechanism is that such mixing dehydrates the low-cloud layer at a rate that increases as the climate warms, and this rate of increase depends on the initial mixing strength, linking the mixing to cloud feedback. The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {The initial value problem of the nonlinear evolution, shoreline motion and flow velocities of long waves climbing sloping beaches is solved analytically for different initial waveforms. A major difficulty in earlier work utilizing hodograph-type transformation when solving either boundary value or initial value problems has been the specification of equivalent boundary or initial condition in the transformed space. Here, in solving the initial value problem, the transformation is linearized in space at t = 0, then the full nonlinear transformation is used to solve the initial value problem of the nonlinear shallow-water wave equations. A solution method is presented to describe the most physically realistic initial waveforms and simplified equations for the runup-rundown motions and shoreline velocities. This linearization of the initial condition does not appear to affect the subsequent nonlinear evolution, as shown through comparisons with earlier studies. Comparisons with runup results from solutions of the boundary value problem suggest the same variation with the runup laws. The methodology presented here appears simpler than earlier work as it does not involve the numerical calculation of singular elliptic integrals. {\textcopyright} 2004 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {We provide a dynamics-based comparison on the results from three-dimensional and two-dimensional simulations of hurricane storin surge. We begin with the question, What may have occurred in the Tampa Bay, Florida vicinity had Hurricane Ivan made landfall there instead of at the border between Alabama and Florida? This question is explored using a three-dimensional, primitive equation, finite volume coastal ocean model. The results show that storm surges are potentially disastrous for the Tampa Bay area, especially for landfalls located to the north of the bay mouth. The worst case among the simulations considered is for landfall at Tarpon Springs, such that the maximum wind is positioned at the bay mouth. Along with such regional aspects of storm surge, we then consider the dynamical balances to assess the importance of using a three-dimensional model instead of the usual, vertically integrated, two-dimensional approach to hurricane storm surge simulation. With hurricane storm surge deriving from the vertically integrated pressure gradient force tending to balance the difference between the surface and bottom stresses, we show that three-dimensional structure is intrinsically important. Two-dimensional models may overestimate (or underestimate) bottom stress, necessitating physically unrealistic parameterizations, of surface stress or other techniques for model calibration. Our examination of the dynamical balances inherent to storm surges over complex coastal topography suggests that three-dimensional models are preferable over two-dimensional models for simulating storm surges.

abstract = {We consider the use of probabilistic neural networks for fluid flow surrogate modeling and data recovery. This framework is constructed by assuming that the target variables are sampled from a Gaussian distribution conditioned on the inputs. Consequently, the overall formulation sets up a procedure to predict the hyperparameters of this distribution which are then used to compute an objective function given training data. We demonstrate that this framework has the ability to provide for prediction confidence intervals based on the assumption of a probabilistic posterior, given an appropriate model architecture and adequate training data. The applicability of the present framework to cases with noisy measurements and limited observations is also assessed. To demonstrate the capabilities of this framework, we consider canonical regression problems of fluid dynamics from the viewpoint of reduced-order modeling and spatial data recovery for four canonical data sets. The examples considered in this study arise from (i) the shallow-water equations, (ii) a two-dimensional cylinder flow, (iii) the wake of a NACA0012 airfoil with a Gurney flap, and (iv) the NOAA sea surface temperature data set. The present results indicate that the probabilistic neural network not only produces a machine-learning-based fluid flow surrogate model but also systematically quantifies the uncertainty therein to assist with model interpretability.},

The coastal annual harmonic has amplitudes that range from 2 cm to 9 cm, peaking between August and October and semi-annual harmonic with maximum amplitude of 6 cm, with most stations peaking in April and October. The coastal seasonal sea level cycle contributes significantly at most areas to sea level variability and can explain the sea level variance up to 78{\%}. The barometric effect on the coastal sea level seasonal cycles is insignificant in the annual component but dominant at 9 stations in the semi-annual cycle. The seasonal sea level cycle from 18 years of altimetry confirm the results obtained from the tide-gauges and allow us to identify some dominant sea level forcing parameters in the annual and semi-annual frequencies such as the Panama-Colombia gyre driven by the wind stress curl and the Caribbean Low Level Jet modulating the sea level in the northern coast of South America and linked to the local upwelling. The seasonal sea level cycle in the Caribbean Sea is unsteady in time, with large variations in amplitude and phase lag at most of the stations, where the 5-year amplitude in the coastal annual cycle can change over 6 cm in a 24 year period. The seasonal sea level cycle peaks about October when the probability of coastal impacts increases, especially in the northern coast of South America where the range is larger.},

abstract = {AbstractPackets of nonlinear internal waves (NLIWs) in a small area of the Mid-Atlantic Bight were 10 times more energetic during a local neap tide than during the preceding spring tide. This counterintuitive result cannot be explained if the waves are generated near the shelf break by the local barotropic tide since changes in shelfbreak stratification explain only a small fraction of the variability in barotropic to baroclinic conversion. Instead, this study suggests that the occurrence of strong NLIWs was caused by the shoaling of distantly generated internal tides with amplitudes that are uncorrelated with the local spring-neap cycle. An extensive set of moored observations show that NLIWs are correlated with the internal tide but uncorrelated with barotropic tide. Using harmonic analysis of a 40-day record, this study associates steady-phase motions at the shelf break with waves generated by the local barotropic tide and variable-phase motions with the shoaling of distantly generated internal tides. ...},

We show that 55{\%} of the world coastlines face compound storm surge wave extremes. Hence, for a given level of probability, neglecting these dependencies leads to underestimating extreme coastal water levels. Dependencies are dominant in midlatitudes and are likely underestimated in the tropics due to limited representation of tropical cyclones. Furthermore, we show that in half of the areas with dependence, the estimated probability of occurrence of coastal extreme water levels increases significantly when it is accounted for. Translated in terms of return periods, this means that along 30{\%} of global coastlines, extreme water levels expected at most once in a century without considering dependence between storm surges and waves become a 1 in 50-year event.},

abstract = {The potential for storm surge to cause extensive property damage and loss of life has increased urgency to more accurately predict coastal flooding associated with landfalling tropical cyclones. This work investigates the sensitivity of coastal inundation from storm tide (surge + tide) to four hurricane parameters-track, intensity, size, and translation speed-and the sensitivity of inundation forecasts to errors in forecasts of those parameters. An ensemble of storm tide simulations is generated for three storms in the Gulf of Mexico, by driving a storm surge model with best track data and systematically generated perturbations of storm parameters from the best track. The spread of the storm perturbations is compared to average errors in recent operational hurricane forecasts, allowing sensitivity results to be interpreted in terms of practical predictability of coastal inundation at different lead times. Two types of inundation metrics are evaluated: point-based statistics and spatially integrated volumes. The practical predictability of surge inundation is found to be limited foremost by current errors in hurricane track forecasts, followed by intensity errors, then speed errors. Errors in storm size can also play an important role in limiting surge predictability at short lead times, due to observational uncertainty. Results show that given current mean errors in hurricane forecasts, location-specific surge inundation is predictable for as little as 12-24 h prior to landfall, less for small-sized storms. The results also indicate potential for increased surge predictability beyond 24 h for large storms by considering a storm-following, volume-integrated metric of inundation.},

abstract = {This study presents a new storm surge hazard potential index (SSHPI) for estimating tropical cyclone (TC) induced peak surge levels at a coast. The SSHPI incorporates parameters that are often readily available at real-time: intensity in 10-min maximum wind speed, radius of 50-kt wind, translation speed, coastal geometry, and bathymetry information. The inclusion of translation speed and coastal geometry information lead to improvements of the SSHPI to other existing surge indices. A retrospective analysis of SSHPI using data from 1978–2019 in Japan suggests that this index captures historical events reasonably well. In particular, it explains {\~{}} 66{\%} of the observed variance and {\~{}} 74{\%} for those induced by TCs whose landfall intensity was larger than 79-kt. The performance of SSHPI is not sensitive to the type of coastal geometry (open coasts or semi-enclosed bays). Such a prediction methodology can decrease numerical computation requirements, improve public awareness of surge hazards, and may also be useful for communicating surge risk.},

abstract = {The representation of extratropical cyclone (ETC) precipitation in general circulation models (GCMs) and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model is analyzed. This work considers the link between ETC precipitation and dynamical strength and tests if parameterized convection affects this link for ETCs in the North Atlantic basin. Lagrangian cyclone tracks of ETCs in ERA-Interim (ERAI), GISS and GFDL CMIP5 models, and WRF with two horizontal resolutions are utilized in a compositing analysis. The 20-km-resolution WRF Model generates stronger ETCs based on surface wind speed and cyclone precipitation. The GCMs and ERAI generate similar composite means and distributions for cyclone precipitation rates, but GCMs generate weaker cyclone surface winds than ERAI. The amount of cyclone precipitation generated by the convection scheme differs significantly across the datasets, with the GISS model generating the most, followed by ERAI and then the GFDL model. The models and reanalysis generate relatively more parameterized convective precipitation when the total cyclone-averaged precipitation is smaller. This is partially due to the contribution of parameterized convective precipitation occurring more often late in the ETC's life cycle. For reanalysis and models, precipitation increases with both cyclone moisture and surface wind speed, and this is true if the contribution from the parameterized convection scheme is larger or not. This work shows that these different models generate similar total ETC precipitation despite large differences in the parameterized convection, and these differences do not cause unexpected behavior in ETC precipitation sensitivity to cyclone moisture or surface wind speed.},

abstract = {A newly developed hybrid-coordinate ocean circulation model is documented and tested. Coordinate surfaces in this model adhere to isopycnals wherever this does not violate minimum layer thickness requirements; elsewhere, coordinate surfaces are geometrically constrained. The intent of this approach, some of whose features are reminiscent of the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) technique, is to combine the best features of isopycnic-coordinate and fixed-grid circulation models within a single framework. The hybrid model is an offshoot of the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model whose solutions, obtained under identical geographic and forcing conditions, serve as reference. Century-scale simulations on a coarse-mesh near-global domain show considerable similarities in the modeled thermohaline-forced circulation. Certain architectural details, such as the choice of prognostic thermodynamic variables ($\rho$,S versus T,S) and the algorithm for moving coordinate surfaces toward their reference isopycnals, are found to only have a minor impact on the solution. Emphasis in this article is on the numerical resiliency of the hybrid coordinate approach. Exploitation of the model's flexible coordinate layout in areas of ocean physics where pure isopycnic coordinate models only have limited options, such as mixed-layer turbulence parameterization, will be the subject of forthcoming articles.},

abstract = {An investigation of sensible and latent heat fluxes and their relation to synoptic weather events was performed using hourly meteorological measurements from National Data Buoy Center buoy 45003, located in northern Lake Huron, during April-November of 1984. Two temporal heat flux regimes were found to exist over Lake Huron. The first period extended from April through July and was characterized by periods of modest negative (downward) heat fluxes. The second regime was marked by periods of large positive (upward) heat fluxes and occurred from August through November. This later period accounted for 95{\%}-100{\%} of both the total positive sensible and latent heat fluxes. In addition, a comparison of the seasonal evolution of sensible and latent heat fluxes showed the transition from the negative to the positive flux regime occurred 10-20 days earlier for latent heat flux than for sensible heat flux. A notable, statistically significant increase of the surface heat flux variability from the negative to positive flux regimes with a general decrease in the near-surface atmospheric stability during the positive flux regime was found. During both flux regimes, the magnitude of surface sensible and latent heat fluxes remained coupled to transient synoptic-scale weather events. On average, the occurrences of minimum (maximum) heat fluxes preceded time periods of low (high) sea level pressure by 0-3 h during the negative flux regime. For the positive flux regime, maximum (minimum) surface heat fluxes followed the passage of low (high) pressure by approximately 24 h. In addition, maximum (minimum) sensible and latent heat fluxes preceded synoptic high (low) pressure by approximately 16 h. Typical synoptic surface weather patterns were identified for both significant positive and negative heat flux events, time periods when the atmosphere-lake heat exchange was maximized.},

Several numerical experiments, including different model dimensions (two-dimension or three-dimension), prescribed open boundary conditions (without or with mean sea surface elevation), astronomical tidal forcing, stratifications (without or with baroclinic effect) and wind forcing, are carried out. The resulted time series of surface elevation data are stored to yield harmonic constants for the four most significant constituents, M2, S2, K1and O1, and the computed harmonic constants are compared with the observed ones. It is shown that the predicted tidal harmonic constants by the three-dimensional model are better than those by the two-dimensional one; with astronomical tidal forcing and mean sea surface elevation at the open boundary, the predicted accuracy could be improved and it is recommended that the baroclinic effect and wind forcing are also included in the modeling.

abstract = {Within the framework of ocean general circulation modeling, the present paper describes an efficient way to discretize partial differential equations on curved surfaces by means of the finite element method on triangular meshes. Our approach benefits from the inherent flexibility of the finite element method. The key idea consists in a dialog between a local coordinate system defined for each element in which integration takes place, and a nodal coordinate system in which all local contributions related to a vectorial degree of freedom are assembled. Since each element of the mesh and each degree of freedom are treated in the same way, the so-called pole singularity issue is fully circumvented. Applied to the shallow water equations expressed in primitive variables, this new approach has been validated against the standard test set defined by [Williamson, D.L., Drake, J.B., Hack, J.J., Jakob, R., Swarztrauber, P.N., 1992. A standard test set for numerical approximations to the shallow water equations in spherical geometry. Journal of Computational Physics 102, 211-224]. Optimal rates of convergence for the P1NC - P1 finite element pair are obtained, for both global and local quantities of interest.

It includes an assessment of the ability and likelihood of debris transport, as constrained by the topography and the constructed environment. Data from aerial surveys and on-ground surveys after the March 2011 Tohoku tsunami are used to demonstrate and validate the considerations proposed for an assessment of debris and its transport.

abstract = {A new immersed boundary (IB) technique for the simulation of flow interacting with solid boundary is presented. The present formulation employs a mixture of Eulerian and Lagrangian variables, where the solid boundary is represented by discrete Lagrangian markers embedding in and exerting forces to the Eulerian fluid domain. The interactions between the Lagrangian markers and the fluid variables are linked by a simple discretized delta function. The numerical integration is based on a second-order fractional step method under the staggered grid spatial framework. Based on the direct momentum forcing on the Eulerian grids, a new force formulation on the Lagrangian marker is proposed, which ensures the satisfaction of the no-slip boundary condition on the immersed boundary in the intermediate time step. This forcing procedure involves solving a banded linear system of equations whose unknowns consist of the boundary forces on the Lagrangian markers; thus, the order of the unknowns is one-dimensional lower than the fluid variables. Numerical experiments show that the stability limit is not altered by the proposed force formulation, though the second-order accuracy of the adopted numerical scheme is degraded to 1.5 order. Four different test problems are simulated using the present technique (rotating ring flow, lid-driven cavity and flows over a stationary cylinder and an in-line oscillating cylinder), and the results are compared with previous experimental and numerical results. The numerical evidences show the accuracy and the capability of the proposed method for solving complex geometry flow problems both with stationary and moving boundaries.},

abstract = {AbstractThe second version of the NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) was made operational at NCEP in March 2011. This version has upgrades to nearly all aspects of the data assimilation and forecast model components of the system. A coupled reanalysis was made over a 32-yr period (1979–2010), which provided the initial conditions to carry out a comprehensive reforecast over 29 years (1982–2010). This was done to obtain consistent and stable calibrations, as well as skill estimates for the operational subseasonal and seasonal predictions at NCEP with CFSv2. The operational implementation of the full system ensures a continuity of the climate record and provides a valuable up-to-date dataset to study many aspects of predictability on the seasonal and subseasonal scales. Evaluation of the reforecasts show that the CFSv2 increases the length of skillful MJO forecasts from 6 to 17 days (dramatically improving subseasonal forecasts), nearly doubles the skill of seasonal forecasts of 2-m temperatures over the United States, and significantly improves global SST forecasts over its predecessor. The CFSv2 not only provides greatly improved guidance at these time scales but also creates many more products for subseasonal and seasonal forecasting with an extensive set of retrospective forecasts for users to calibrate their forecast products. These retrospective and real-time operational forecasts will be used by a wide community of users in their decision making processes in areas such as water management for rivers and agriculture, transportation, energy use by utilities, wind and other sustainable energy, and seasonal prediction of the hurricane season.},

abstract = {Forecasting hurricane impacts of extreme winds and flooding requires accurate prediction of hurricane structure and storm-induced ocean surface waves days in advance. The waves are complex, especially near landfall when the hurricane winds and water depth varies significantly and the surface waves refract, shoal and dissipate. In this study, we examine the spatial structure, magnitude, and directional spectrum of hurricane-induced ocean waves using a high resolution, fully coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean model and observations. The coupled model predictions of ocean surface waves in Hurricane Ike (2008) over the Gulf of Mexico and Superstorm Sandy (2012) in the northeastern Atlantic and coastal region are evaluated with the NDBC buoy and satellite altimeter observations. Although there are characteristics that are general to ocean waves in both hurricanes as documented in previous studies, wave fields in Ike and Sandy possess unique properties due mostly to the distinct wind fields and coastal bathymetry in the two storms. Several processes are found to significantly modulate hurricane surface waves near landfall. First, the phase speed and group velocities decrease as the waves become shorter and steeper in shallow water, effectively increasing surface roughness and wind stress. Second, the bottom-induced refraction acts to turn the waves toward the coast, increasing the misalignment between the wind and waves. Third, as the hurricane translates over land, the left side of the storm center is characterized by offshore winds over very short fetch, which opposes incoming swell. Landfalling hurricanes produce broader wave spectra overall than that of the open ocean. The front-left quadrant is most complex, where the combination of windsea, swell propagating against the wind, increasing wind-wave stress, and interaction with the coastal topography requires a fully coupled model to meet these challenges in hurricane wave and surge prediction.},

abstract = {Storm surges cause coastal inundation due to setup of the water surface resulting from atmospheric pressure, surface winds and breaking waves. Here we show that during Typhoon Haiyan, the setup generated by breaking waves near the fringing-reef-protected town of Hernani, the Philippines, oscillated with the incidence of large and small wave groups, and steepened into a tsunami-like wave that caused extensive damage and casualties. Though fringing reefs usually protect coastal communities from moderate storms, they can exacerbate flooding during strong events with energetic waves. Typical for reef-type bathymetries, a very short wave-breaking zone over the steep reef face facilitates the freeing of infragravity-period fluctuations (surf beat) with little energy loss. Since coastal flood planning relies on phase-averaged wave modelling, infragravity surges are not being accounted for. This highlights the necessity for a policy change and the adoption of phase-resolving wave models for hazard assessment in regions with fringing reefs.},

@article{Fritz2001,
abstract = {On July 8, 1958, an 8.3 magnitude earthquake along the Fairweather fault triggered a major subaerial rockslide into Gilbert Inlet at the head of Lituya Bay on the South coast of Alaska. The rockslide impacted the water at high speed creating a giant nonlinear wave and the highest wave run-up in recorded history. The soliton like wave ran up to an altitude of 524 m causing forest destruction and erosion down to bedrock on a spur ridge in direct prolongation of the slide axis. Total area between trimline of forest destruction on shores of Lituya Bay and high-tide shoreline covered about 10 km*. A cross-section of Gilbert Inlet was rebuilt at 1:675 scale in a two-dimensional physical laboratory model at VAW. The subaerial rockslide impact into Gilbert Inlet, wave generation, propagation and run-up on headland slope were considered in a geometrically undistorted Froude similarity model. A novel pneumatic landslide generator was used to generate a high-speed granular slide with controlled impact characteristics. State-of-the-art laser measurement techniques such as particle image velocimetry (PIV) and laser distance sensors (LDS) were applied to the decisive initial phase with rockslide impact and wave generation. PIV-measurements of wave run-up on headland slope were conducted to complement wave and run-up gage records. PIV provided instantaneous velocity vector fields in a large area of interest and gave insight into kinematics of wave generation and run-up. The whole process of a high speed granular slide impact may be subdivided into two main stages: a) Rockslide impact and penetration with flow separation, cavity formation and wave generation, and b) air cavity collapse with rockslide run-out and debris detrainment causing massive phase mixing. Impact stages overlap and their transition from wave generation to propagation and run-up is fluent. Formation of a large air cavity - similar to an asteroid impact - in the back of the rockslide is highlighted. The laboratory experiments confirm that the 1958 trimline of forest destruction on Lituya Bay shores was carved by a giant rockslide generated impulse wave. The measured wave run-up perfectly matches the trimline of forest destruction on the spur ridge at Gilbert Inlet. Back-calculation of wave height from observed trimline of forest destruction using Hall and Watts (1953) run-up formula equals measured wave height in Gilbert Inlet. PIV-measurements of wave run-up indicate that enough water ran up the headland slope to cause the flooding observed in Lituya Bay as estimated by Mader (1999) with numerical simulations of the whole Lituya Bay.},

Additional capabilities have been built into the system, including flow-dependent background-error correlations and background-error variances that vary in space and evolve from one analysis cycle to the next. The ocean data types assimilated include: remotely sensed sea surface temperature, sea surface height, and sea-ice concentration; plus in situ surface and sub-surface observations of temperature, salinity, and currents from a variety of sources, such as ships, buoys, expendable bathythermographs, sensors, and profiling floats. An ocean data quality-control system is fully integrated with the multivariate analysis, and includes feedback of forecast fields and prediction errors in the quality control of new observations. The system is operational at the US Navy oceanographic production centres both in global and in regional applications. It is being implemented as the data assimilation component of the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model as part of the US contribution to the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment, and in a limited-area ensemble-based forecasting system that will be used in an adaptive sampling, targeted observation application.

abstract = {In the face of future climate change, it is prudent to seek sustainable adaptation strategies to address regional and local impacts. These impacts are multidimensional, involving interdependencies between systems (weather, urban land use, agriculture, etc.) that are typically modeled independently. To achieve a holistic understanding and thus identify more effective strategies for addressing and/or mitigating impacts, an integrated interdisciplinary research approach is essential. Here we discuss the broader challenges and threats faced by regions encompassing large bodies of water. We illustrate with North America's Great Lakes region, discussing how an integrated model of atmosphere, land, and lake could provide critical information to inform decisions. We stress the need to include input from diverse stakeholders in the development of tools to ensure the quality and usability of impact assessments. Research investments toward such capabilities should engage multiple disciplines including atmospheric sciences, hydrodynamics, hydrology, and biogeochemistry as well as data analytics and modeling. Also, detailed measurement and documentation of urban and agricultural land use, lake surface temperature and ice-cover, and observations of energy and mass exchanges at the interfaces of atmosphere, land, and water are needed. We envision the development of an integrated set of modeling tools that will improve both the utility of weather forecasts and long-term climate projections of the impacts on ecosystem sustainability, hydrometeorological extremes, engineering design, human health, and socioeconomic systems. Such a modeling system can serve as a template for other regions with cities, large lakes, inland seas, and coastlines facing similar kinds of climate change impacts.},

abstract = {The 39-day long eruption at the summit of Eyjafjallaj{\"{o}}kull volcano in April-May 2010 was of modest size but ash was widely dispersed. By combining data from ground surveys and remote sensing we show that the erupted material was 4.8±1.2{\textperiodcentered}10¹¹ kg (benmoreite and trachyte, dense rock equivalent volume 0.18±0.05 km³). About 20{\%} was lava and water-transported tephra, 80{\%} was airborne tephra (bulk volume 0.27 km³) transported by 3-10 km high plumes. The airborne tephra was mostly fine ash (diameter {\textless}1000 µm). At least 7{\textperiodcentered}10¹⁰ kg (70 Tg) was very fine ash ({\textless}28 µm), several times more than previously estimated via satellite retrievals. About 50{\%} of the tephra fell in Iceland with the remainder carried towards south and east, detected over {\~{}}7 million km² in Europe and the North Atlantic. Of order 10¹⁰ kg (2{\%}) are considered to have been transported longer than 600-700 km with {\textless}10⁸ kg ({\textless}0.02{\%}) reaching mainland Europe.},

abstract = {A global atmospheric model with roughly 50-km horizontal grid spacing is used to simulate the interannual variability of tropical cyclones using observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) as the lower boundary condition. The model's convective parameterization is based on a closure for shallow convection, with much of the deep convection allowed to occur on resolved scales. Four realizations of the period 1981-2005 are generated. The correlation of yearly Atlantic hurricane counts with observations is greater than 0.8 when the model is averaged over the four realizations, supporting the view that the random part of this annual Atlantic hurricane frequency (the part not predictable given the SSTs) is relatively small ({\textless}2 hurricanes per year). Correlations with observations are lower in the east, west, and South Pacific (roughly 0.6, 0.5, and 0.3, respectively) and insignificant in the Indian Ocean. The model trends in Northern Hemisphere basin-wide frequency are consistent with the observed trends in the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) database. The model generates an upward trend of hurricane frequency in the Atlantic and downward trends in the east and west Pacific over this time frame. The model produces a negative trend in the Southern Hemisphere that is larger than that in the IBTrACS. The same model is used to simulate the response to the SST anomalies generated by coupled models in the World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 3 (CMIP3) archive, using the late-twenty-first century in the A1B scenario. Results are presented for SST anomalies computed by averaging over 18 CMIP3 models and from individual realizations from 3 models. A modest reduction of global and Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone frequency is obtained in each case, but the results in individual Northern Hemisphere basins differ among the models. The vertical shear in the Atlantic Main Development Region (MDR) and the difference between theMDRSST and the tropical mean SST are well correlated with the model's Atlantic storm frequency, both for interannual variability and for the intermodel spread in global warming projections. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

We compare the computational results with analytical solutions, other numerical computations and with laboratory data for breaking and nonbreaking solitary waves. We find that the model describes the evolution and runup of nonbreaking waves very well, even when using a very small number of grid points per wavelength. Even though our method does not model the detailed surface profile of wave breaking well, it adequately predicts the runup of plunging solitary waves without ad-hoc assumptions about viscosity and friction.

abstract = {Global warming is expected to drive increasing extreme sea levels (ESLs) and flood risk along the world's coastlines. In this work we present probabilistic projections of ESLs for the present century taking into consideration changes in mean sea level, tides, wind-waves, and storm surges. Between the year 2000 and 2100 we project a very likely increase of the global average 100-year ESL of 34–76 cm under a moderate-emission-mitigation-policy scenario and of 58–172 cm under a business as usual scenario. Rising ESLs are mostly driven by thermal expansion, followed by contributions from ice mass-loss from glaciers, and ice-sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. Under these scenarios ESL rise would render a large part of the tropics exposed annually to the present-day 100-year event from 2050. By the end of this century this applies to most coastlines around the world, implying unprecedented flood risk levels unless timely adaptation measures are taken.},

@article{Buijsman2014,
abstract = {AbstractThe three-dimensional (3D) double-ridge internal tide interference in the Luzon Strait in the South China Sea is examined by comparing 3D and two-dimensional (2D) realistic simulations. Both the 3D simulations and observations indicate the presence of 3D first-mode (semi)diurnal standing waves in the 3.6-km-deep trench in the strait. As in an earlier 2D study, barotropic-to-baroclinic energy conversion, flux divergence, and dissipation are greatly enhanced when semidiurnal tides dominate relative to periods dominated by diurnal tides. The resonance in the 3D simulation is several times stronger than in the 2D simulations for the central strait. Idealized experiments indicate that, in addition to ridge height, the resonance is only a function of separation distance and not of the along-ridge length; that is, the enhanced resonance in 3D is not caused by 3D standing waves or basin modes. Instead, the difference in resonance between the 2D and 3D simulations is attributed to the topographic blocking ...},

@article{Taflanidis2013,
abstract = {A probabilistic framework is presented for evaluation of hurricane wave and surge risk with particular emphasis on real-time automated estimation for hurricanes approaching landfall. This framework has two fundamental components. The first is the development of a surrogate model for the rapid evaluation of hurricane waves, water levels, and run-up based on a small number of parameters describing each hurricane: hurricane landfall location and heading, central pressure, forward speed, and radius of maximum winds. This surrogate model is developed using a response surface methodology fed by information from hundreds of precomputed, high-resolution Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) 1 Advanced CirculationModel for Oceanic, Coastal andEstuarineWaters (ADCIRC) andOne-Dimensional Boussinesq Model (BOUSS-1D) runs. Foraspecific set of hurricane parameters (i.e., a specific landfalling hurricane), the surrogate model is able to evaluate the maximum wave height, water level, and run-up during the storm at a cost that is more than seven orders of magnitude less than the high-fidelity models and thus meets time constraints imposed by emergency managers and decisionmakers. The second component of this framework is a description of the uncertainty in the parameters used to characterize the hurricane through appropriate probability models, which then leads to quantification of hurricane risk in terms of a probabilistic integral. This integral is then efficiently computed using the already established surrogate model by analyzing thousands of different scenarios (based on the aforementioned probabilistic description). This allows the rapid computation of, for example, the storm surge that might be exceeded 10{\%} of the time based on hurricane parameters at 48 h from landfall. Finally, by leveraging the computational simplicity and efficiency of the surrogate model, a simple stand-alone PC-based risk-assessment tool is developed that allows nonexpert end users to take advantage of the full potential of the framework. The proposed framework ultimately facilitates the development of a rapid assessment tool for real-time implementation but requires a considerable upfront computational cost to produce high-fidelity model results. As an illustrative example, implementation of hurricane risk estimation for the Island of Oahu in Hawaii is presented; results demonstrate the versatility of the proposed approach for delivering accurate tools for real-time hurricane risk estimation that have the ability to cross over technology adoption barriers. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

One FE scheme in particular, the PNC 1 –P1 pair, combined with the primitive equations may be advantageously compared with the wave equation formulations and both schemes have similar data structures. Our focus here is on comparing these two approaches for a number of measures including stability, accuracy, efficiency, conservation properties, and consistency. The main part of the analysis centres on stability and accuracy results via Fourier-based dispersion analyses in the context of the linear SW equations.

abstract = {This paper summarizes the main characteristics of the RCP8.5 scenario. The RCP8.5 combines assumptions about high population and relatively slow income growth with modest rates of technological change and energy intensity improvements, leading in the long term to high energy demand and GHG emissions in absence of climate change policies. Compared to the total set of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), RCP8.5 thus corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. Using the IIASA Integrated Assessment Framework and the MESSAGE model for the development of the RCP8.5, we focus in this paper on two important extensions compared to earlier scenarios: 1) the development of spatially explicit air pollution projections, and 2) enhancements in the land-use and land-cover change projections. In addition, we explore scenario variants that use RCP8.5 as a baseline, and assume different degrees of greenhouse gas mitigation policies to reduce radiative forcing. Based on our modeling framework, we find it technically possible to limit forcing from RCP8.5 to lower levels comparable to the other RCPs (2.6 to 6 W/m2). Our scenario analysis further indicates that climate policy-induced changes of global energy supply and demand may lead to significant co-benefits for other policy priorities, such as local air pollution. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract = {A dynamic model for a tension-leg platform (TLP) floating offshore wind turbine is proposed. The model includes three-dimensional wind and wave loads and the associated structural response. The total system is formulated using 17 degrees of freedom (DOF), 6 for the platform motions and 11 for the wind turbine. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic loads have been formulated using a frequency- and direction-dependent spectrum. While wave loads are computed from the wave kinematics using Morison's equation, the aerodynamic loads are modeled by means of unsteady blade-element-momentum (BEM) theory, including Glauert correction for high values of the axial induction factor, dynamic stall, dynamic wake, and dynamic yaw. The aerodynamic model takes into account the wind shear and turbulence effects. For a representative geographical location, platform responses are obtained for a set of wind and wave climatic conditions. The platform responses show an influence from the aerodynamic loads, most clearly through quasi-steady mean surge and pitch responses associated with the mean wind. Further, the aerodynamic loads show an influence from the platform motion through a fluctuating rotor load contribution, which is a consequence of the wave-induced rotor dynamics. Loads and coupled responses are predicted for a set of load cases with different wave headings. Further, an advanced aero-elastic code, Flex5, is extended for the TLP wind turbine configuration and the response comparison with the simpler model shows a generally good agreement, except for the yaw motion. This deviation is found to be a result of the missing lateral tower flexibility in the simpler model. {\textcopyright} 2014 by ASME.},

Large-scale structures with an order of magnitude bigger than the turbine rotor diameter (D) are shown to have substantial contribution to wind power. Varying dynamics in the intermediate scales (D-10D) are also observed from a parametric study involving interturbine distances and hub height of the turbines. Further insight about the eddies responsible for the power generation have been provided from the scaling analysis of two-dimensional premultiplied spectra of MKE flux. The LES code is developed in a high Reynolds number near-wall modeling framework, using an open-source spectral element code Nek5000, and the wind turbines have been modelled using a state-of-the-art actuator line model. The LES of infinite wind farms have been validated against the statistical results from the previous literature. The study is expected to improve our understanding of the complex multiscale dynamics in the domain of large wind farms and identify the length scales that contribute to the power. This information can be useful for design of wind farm layout and turbine placement that take advantage of the large-scale structures contributing to wind turbine power.},

The cost function is based on the average differences of relative vorticity between consecutive track points, weighted by their distance. Last, for each cyclone, the algorithm identifies "an effective area" for which different physical diagnostics are measured, such as the minimum sea level pressure and the maximum wind speed.

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation is used to study the sensitivity of trade wind cumulus clouds to pertur-bations in cloud droplet number concentrations. We find that the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative-convective equilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large-scale advective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends real-istically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number den-sity, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in rel-ative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near-equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized pre-cipitating cumulus cloud field is small.},

abstract = {Global projections of intense tropical cyclone activity are derived from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) High Resolution Atmospheric Model (HiRAM; 50-km grid) and the GFDL hurricane model using a two-stage downscaling procedure. First, tropical cyclone genesis is simulated globally using HiRAM. Each storm is then downscaled into the GFDL hurricane model, with horizontal grid spacing near the storm of 6 km, including ocean coupling (e.g., "cold wake" generation). Simulations are performed using observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) (1980-2008) for a "control run" with 20 repeating seasonal cycles and for a late-twenty-first-century projection using an altered SST seasonal cycle obtained from a phase 5 of CMIP (CMIP5)/representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) multimodel ensemble. In general agreement with most previous studies, projections with this framework indicate fewer tropical cyclones globally in a warmer late-twenty-first-century climate, but also an increase in average cyclone intensity, precipitation rates, and the number and occurrence days of very intense category 4 and 5 storms. While these changes are apparent in the globally averaged tropical cyclone statistics, they are not necessarily present in each individual basin. The interbasin variation of changes in most of the tropical cyclone metrics examined is directly correlated to the variation in magnitude of SST increases between the basins. Finally, the framework is shown to be capable of reproducing both the observed global distribution of outer storm size-albeit with a slight high bias-and its interbasin variability. Projected median size is found to remain nearly constant globally, with increases in most basins offset by decreases in the northwest Pacific.},

abstract = {A surf zone model is developed and tested based on the O($\mu$4) Boussinesq–Green–Naghdi system of Zhang et al. (2013). Because the model is fundamentally rotational, it uses fewer ad hoc assumptions than are found in many Boussinesq breaking wave systems. Eddy viscosity is used to describe both breaking dissipation and bottom friction, with breaking viscosities derived from the turbulent kinetic energy equation coupled with an O($\mu$4) rotational wave model. In contrast, bottom friction is included by imposing the frictional coefficient-derived boundary stress as an equivalent eddy viscosity. Numerical tests for one horizontal dimension show good agreement with regular and irregular wave breaking tests, and for solitary wave runup. Surface elevation decay, setup, runup, interior orbital velocities, and depth-varying undertow velocities can all be modeled reasonably. Comparison with an O($\mu$2) system shows similar performance for water surface elevations in the surf zone, demonstrating that the dissipation model is the major controlling factor. However, the O($\mu$4) model shows significantly improved representations of the velocity profile in the surf zone, as expected.},

Current design techniques of vertical breakwaters in Japan are the culmination of many years of experiences and practical research in this field. The Goda formula, which accurately predicts the design wave forces under most conditions of vertical breakwaters, is an excellent aid in the design of the breakwaters. Under certain conditions, excessive impulsive forces due to the action of breaking waves are exerted on the upright section. Such conditions must be minimized in the design of vertical breakwaters, and the adoption of vertical breakwaters covered with wave dissipating concrete blocks or the wave dissipating caisson breakwaters offer potential solutions of this problem. The bearing capacity of rubble mound foundation and the stability of armor units are also discussed.},

abstract = {The growing prospect for large farms of floating offshore wind turbines requires a better understanding of wake effects for floating turbines, particularly the differences when compared to fixed-bottom turbine wakes. The increased range of motion of floating platforms can influence wake characteristics, affecting downstream turbines. In this work, large eddy simulations with an actuator line model are used to study downstream wake characteristics of the NREL 5 MW reference turbine mounted on the OC3-UMaine spar platform for several different metocean conditions. The simulations are carried out in the Simulator fOr Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA) coupled with OpenFAST for the platform and turbine motion. The downstream wake characteristics of the floating platform are compared to equivalent fixed-bottom cases for different wind speeds, wave heights, wind-wave alignments, and turbine yaw angles. Overall, the differences in wake shape between floating and fixed platforms are associated with mean platform displacements, while differences in turbulence are associated with time-varying platform motion. However, these observed wake differences between fixed and floating platforms are small, especially for higher wind speeds and lower wave heights.},

abstract = {This paper presents a fully integrated coastal process model and a simple parametric cyclonic wind-pressure model for simulation of wind, storm surges, waves, tidal currents, and river flows. By sharing one computational grid within all those process modules and no need for switching executable codes from one module to another, this full-coupling feature eliminates possible errors and loss of information due to interpolation and extrapolation of variables between different grids. To generate better cyclonic wind speed and barometric pressure, this parametric wind model includes nonlinear decay effect on wind intensity after hurricane's landfall. By implementing a new wind energy source term, the wave action model is capable of computing wave growth, propagation, and deformation through a regional-scale domain from deepwater to shallow waters. Model validation and model skill assessment were performed by hindcasting wind, storm surges, waves, and river flows during Hurricane Gustav (2008) by using a high-resolution grid covering the northern Gulf Coast. With improved wind fields estimated by the new parametric wind model, this fully integrated process model produced high-quality wavefields in deep and shallow waters and storm tidal levels in the northern Gulf Coasts. Because of computing efficiency provided by seamless integration of process modules and optimized numerical solution schemes, faster-than-real-time predictions of storm surges for the advisories during Hurricane Isaac (2012) were achieved by running the validated model in a desktop computer.},

The harmonic constants derived from 63 tidal gauge stations and 24 TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) satellite altimeter crossover points are assimilated into the adjoint model to minimize the deviations of the simulated results and observations by optimizing the bottom friction coefficient and the internal tide dissipation coefficient. Tidal constituents M{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, S{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, K{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} are simulated simultaneously.

The tidal energy flux is analyzed based on numerical results. The strongest tidal energy flux appears in the Luzon Strait (LS) for both semi-diurnal and diurnal tidal constituents. The analysis of tidal energy dissipation indicates that the bottom friction dissipation occurs mainly in shallow water area, meanwhile the internal tide dissipation is mainly concentrated in the LS and the deep basin of the SCS. The tidal energetics in the LS is examined showing that the tidal energy input closely balances the tidal energy dissipation.},

abstract = {Internal gravity waves, the subsurface analogue of the familiar surface gravity waves that break on beaches, are ubiquitous in the ocean. Because of their strong vertical and horizontal currents, and the turbulent mixing caused by their breaking, they affect a panoply of ocean processes, such as the supply of nutrients for photosynthesis, sediment and pollutant transport and acoustic transmission; they also pose hazards for man-made structures in the ocean. Generated primarily by the wind and the tides, internal waves can travel thousands of kilometres from their sources before breaking, making it challenging to observe them and to include them in numerical climate models, which are sensitive to their effects. For over a decade, studies have targeted the South China Sea, where the oceans' most powerful known internal waves are generated in the Luzon Strait and steepen dramatically as they propagate west. Confusion has persisted regarding their mechanism of generation, variability and energy budget, however, owing to the lack of in situ data from the Luzon Strait, where extreme flow conditions make measurements difficult. Here we use new observations and numerical models to (1) show that the waves begin as sinusoidal disturbances rather than arising from sharp hydraulic phenomena, (2) reveal the existence of {\textgreater}200-metre-high breaking internal waves in the region of generation that give rise to turbulence levels {\textgreater}10,000 times that in the open ocean, (3) determine that the Kuroshio western boundary current noticeably refracts the internal wave field emanating from the Luzon Strait, and (4) demonstrate a factor-of-two agreement between modelled and observed energy fluxes, which allows us to produce an observationally supported energy budget of the region. Together, these findings give a cradle-to-grave picture of internal waves on a basin scale, which will support further improvements of their representation in numerical climate predictions.},

abstract = {Numerical storm surge models are essential to forecasting coastal flood hazard and informing the design of coastal defences. However, such models rely on a variety of inputs, many of which carry uncertainty. An awareness and understanding of the sensitivity of model outputs with respect to those uncertain inputs is therefore essential when interpreting model results. Here, we use an unstructured-mesh numerical coastal ocean model, Thetis, and its adjoint, to perform a sensitivity analysis for a hindcast of the 5th/6th December 2013 North Sea surge event, with respect to the bottom friction coefficient, bathymetry and wind stress forcing. The results reveal spatial and temporal patterns of sensitivity, providing physical insight into the mechanisms of surge generation and propagation. For example, the sensitivity of the skew surge to the bathymetry reveals the protective effect of a sand bank off the UK east coast. The results can also be used to propagate uncertainties through the numerical model; based on estimates of model input uncertainties, we estimate that modelled skew surges carry uncertainties of around 5 cm and 15 cm due to bathymetry and bottom friction, respectively. While these uncertainties are small compared with the typical spread in an ensemble storm surge forecast due to uncertain meteorological inputs, the adjoint-derived model sensitivities can nevertheless be used to inform future model calibration and data acquisition efforts in order to reduce uncertainty. Our results demonstrate the power of adjoint methods to gain insight into a storm surge model, providing information complementary to traditional ensemble uncertainty quantification methods.},

abstract = {AbstractImpact on a column by an idealized 1:5-scale shipping container propelled by tsunami flow was modeled in a large-scale wave flume. Results from hydraulic experiments were compared with corresponding data from in-air impact experiments using the same experimental configuration to assess the hydrodynamic effects on impact force and duration. Experiments were conducted by varying flow conditions, velocity, and nonstructural mass. An aluminum specimen was tested empty and with the addition of nonstructural mass to simulate partially loaded shipping containers. The measured peak impact forces from the longitudinal test in water were observed to have an increase no greater than 17{\%} of the corresponding measured peak impact forces from the longitudinal test in air. The impact duration measured from the in-air test provided a lower bound for the impact duration measured for the in-water tests. Hydraulic effects were shown to increase the impact duration by an average of 20{\%}. The additional nonstructural m...},

abstract = {The effects of a parameterized linear internal wave drag on the semidiurnal barotropic and baroclinic energetics of a realistically forced, three-dimensional global ocean model are analyzed. Although the main purpose of the parameterization is to improve the surface tides, it also influences the internal tides. The relatively coarse resolution of the model of {\~{}}8 km only permits the generation and propagation of the first three vertical modes. Hence, this wave drag parameterization represents the energy conversion to and the subsequent breaking of the unresolved high modes. The total tidal energy input and the spatial distribution of the barotropic energy loss agree with the Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon (TPXO) tidal inversion model. The wave drag overestimates the high-mode conversion at ocean ridges as measured against regional high-resolution models. The wave drag also damps the low-mode internal tides as they propagate away from their generation sites. Hence, it can be considered a scattering parameterization, causing more than 50{\%} of the deep-water dissipation of the internal tides. In the near field, most of the baroclinic dissipation is attributed to viscous and numerical dissipation. The far-field decay of the simulated internal tides is in agreement with satellite altimetry and falls within the broad range of Argo-inferred dissipation rates. In the simulation, about 12{\%} of the semidiurnal internal tide energy generated in deep water reaches the continental margins.},

abstract = {Inlet wave–current dynamics and interactions are vital to the physical exchanges in a lagoon–inlet–coastal ocean system. A wave–current coupled model was calibrated and validated against observational data, and then applied to investigate the complex dynamics in the Maryland Coastal Bays during Hurricane Irene (2011). With the inclusion of wave–current interactions, skill in simulating the maximum total water surface elevation was improved under hurricane conditions. Major processes of wave–current interactions include the radiation stress-induced setup and current, and water depth variation-induced wave breaking. Wave-induced bottom friction and sea surface roughness are of secondary importance to nearshore dynamics. Further investigations reveal that tidal currents and ocean swells dominate inlet circulation and wave dynamics, respectively. Physical dynamics within the paired inlets are regulated by local winds, wave–current interactions, and unique inlet characteristics. However, wave dynamics in the lagoon and behind inlets are dominated by local winds and modulated by the shallow bathymetry. With the hypothetical closure of any inlet, wave–current dynamics and interactions behind the corresponding inlet are strongly altered, whereas they are weakly influenced from a remote one. Occasionally, the circulation near the narrow Ocean City Inlet area is influenced moderately by artificially shutting down the relatively wider Chincoteague Inlet. The finding from this work on the Maryland Coastal Bays can be beneficial to understanding similar lagoon–inlet–coastal ocean systems elsewhere.},

abstract = {This study uses Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model to evaluate the performance of six dynamical downscaled decadal historical simulations with 12-km resolution for a large domain (7200 × 6180 km) that covers most of North America. The initial and boundary conditions are from three global climate models (GCMs) and one reanalysis data. The GCMs employed in this study are the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model with Generalized Ocean Layer Dynamics component, Community Climate System Model, version 4, and the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model, version 2-Earth System. The reanalysis data is from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-US. Department of Energy Reanalysis II. We analyze the effects of bias correcting, the lateral boundary conditions and the effects of spectral nudging. We evaluate the model performance for seven surface variables and four upper atmospheric variables based on their climatology and extremes for seven subregions across the United States. The results indicate that the simulation's performance depends on both location and the features/variable being tested. We find that the use of bias correction and/or nudging is beneficial in many situations, but employing these when running the RCM is not always an improvement when compared to the reference data. The use of an ensemble mean and median leads to a better performance in measuring the climatology, while it is significantly biased for the extremes, showing much larger differences than individual GCM driven model simulations from the reference data. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of these historical model runs in order to make informed decisions when making future projections.},

It is found that flow rates through the submerged breakwater opening, and thus the resulting inundation heights, are similar between 2DH and 2CLOWNS-3D model simulations when an appropriate momentum dispersion coefficient is applied to the former. However, significant differences between the model simulations are identified in relation to; hydrodynamic forces acting on the submerged caissons, velocities in the large-scale jet structure emanating from the break- water, and bed shear stresses in the vicinity of the breakwater. Furthermore, the characteristics of the large-scale jet structure simulated by the 3D model are reasonable when employing the realizable k-$\epsilon$ turbulence closure. Our results demonstrate the practical merit of 2CLOWNS-3D for simulating complex geophysical scale flows.},

abstract = {Previous attempts to describe the structure of wind turbine wakes and their mutual interaction were mostly limited to large-eddy and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations using finite-volume solvers. We employ the higher-order spectral-element code Nek5000 to study the influence of numerical aspects on the prediction of the wind turbine wake structure and the wake interaction between two turbines. The spectral-element method enables an accurate representation of the vortical structures, with lower numerical dissipation than the more commonly used finite-volume codes. The wind-turbine blades are modeled as body forces using the actuator-line method (ACL) in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Both tower and nacelle are represented with appropriate body forces. An inflow boundary condition is used which emulates homogeneous isotropic turbulence of wind-tunnel flows. We validate the implementation with results from experimental campaigns undertaken at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU Blind Tests), investigate parametric influences and compare computational aspects with existing numerical simulations. In general the results show good agreement between the experiments and the numerical simulations both for a single-turbine setup as well as a two-turbine setup where the turbines are offset in the spanwise direction. A shift in the wake center caused by the tower wake is detected similar to experiments. The additional velocity deficit caused by the tower agrees well with the experimental data. The wake is captured well by Nek5000 in comparison with experiments both for the single wind turbine and in the two-turbine setup. The blade loading however shows large discrepancies for the high-turbulence, two-turbine case. While the experiments predicted higher thrust for the downstream turbine than for the upstream turbine, the opposite case was observed in Nek5000.},

An idealized application to vortex propagation on a $\beta$ plane shows agreement between nested and high resolution solutions. A realistic application to the California Current System then confirm these results in a complex configuration. The selected algorithm is now part of ROMS{\_}AGRIF. It is fully consistent with ROMS parallel capabilities on both shared and distributed memory architectures.

abstract = {This paper presents the numerical modelling of the cross shore propagation of infragravity waves induced by a transient focused short wave group over a sloping bottom. A dataset obtained through new laboratory experiments in the wave flume of the University of Cantabria is used to validate the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes type model IH-2VOF. A new boundary condition based on the wave maker movement used in the experiments is implemented in the model. Shoaling and breaking of short waves as well as the enhancement of long waves and the energy transfer to low-frequency motion are well addressed by the model, proving the high accuracy in the reproduction of surf zone hydrodynamics. Under the steep slope regime, a long wave trough is radiated offshore from the breakpoint. Numerical simulations conducted for different bottom slopes and short wave steepness suggest that this low-frequency breakpoint generated wave is controlled by both the bed slope parameter and the Iribarren number. Moreover, the numerical model is used to investigate the influence that a large flat bottom induces on the propagation pattern of long waves.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the development of a kriging surrogate model for storm surge prediction utilizing an existing database of high-fidelity, synthetic storms. This surrogate model (metamodel) provides a fast-to-compute mathematical approximation to the input/output relationship of the computationally expensive simulation model that created this database. The implementation is considered over a large coastal region composed of nearshore nodes (locations where storm surge is predicted) and further examines the ability to provide time-series forecasting. This setting creates a high-dimensional output (over a few thousand surge responses) for the surrogate model with anticipated high spatial/temporal correlation. Kriging is considered as a surrogate model, and special attention is given to the appropriate parameterization of the synthetic storms, based on the characteristics of the given database, to determine the input for the metamodel formulation. Principal component analysis (PCA) is integrated in this formulation as a dimension reduction technique to improve computational efficiency, as well as to provide accurate and continuous predictions for time-dependent outputs without the need to introduce time averaging in the time-series forecasting. This is established by leveraging the aforementioned correlation characteristics within the initial database. A range of different implementation choices is examined within the integrated kriging/PCA setting, such as the development of single or multiple metamodels for the different outputs. The metamodel accuracy for inland nodes that have remained dry in some of the storms in the initial database is also examined. The performance of the surrogate modeling approach is evaluated through a case study, utilizing a database of 446 synthetic storms for the Gulf of Mexico (Louisiana coast). The output considered includes time histories for 30 locations over a period of 45.5 h with 92 uniform time steps, as well as peak responses over a grid of 545,635 nearshore nodes. High accuracy and computational efficiency are observed for the proposed implementation, whereas including the prediction error statistics provides estimations with significant safety margins.},

The extensive field data reported in Part I of the series (Filloux and Snyder, 1979) are compared with tidal computations using a modified elliptic model first developed by Sidjabat (1970). This model, a multiconstituent generalization of the “hamonic method” of Dronkers (1964), is based on a polynomial representation for the magnitude of the current which provides a tractable resolution of bottom friction, resulting in a coupled set of time-independent equations governing the individual constituents. This resolution naturally spots the bottom friction into a part which can be absorbed on the left-hand (operator) side of the constituent equations and a part which can be treated as multilinear source terms on the right-hand side. The contribution to the left-hand side is large enough that the resulting coupled set may be solved iteratively, converging rapidl...},

@article{Zijl2015,
abstract = {For the Netherlands, accurate water level forecasting in the coastal region is crucial, since large areas of the land lie below sea level. During storm surges, detailed and timely water level forecasts provided by an operational storm surge forecasting system are necessary to support, for example, the decision to close the movable storm surge barriers in the Eastern Scheldt and the Rotterdam Waterway. In the past years, a new generation operational tide-surge model (Dutch Continental Shelf Model version 6) has been developed covering the northwest European continental shelf. In a previous study, a large effort has been put in representing relevant physical phenomena in this process model as well as reducing parameter uncertainty over a wide area. While this has resulted in very accurate water level representation (root-mean-square error (RMSE) {\^{a}}ˆ¼7{\^{a}}€“8{\^{A}} cm), during severe storm surges, the errors in the meteorological model forcing are generally non-negligible and can cause forecast errors of several decimetres. By integrating operationally available observational data in the forecast model by means of real-time data assimilation, the errors in the meteorological forcing are prevented from propagating to the hydrodynamic tide-surge model forecasts. This paper discusses the development of a computationally efficient steady-state Kalman filter to enhance the predictive quality for the shorter lead times by improving the system state at the start of the forecast. Besides evaluating the model quality against shelf-wide tide gauge observations for a year-long hindcast simulation, the predictive value of the Kalman filter is determined by comparing the forecast quality for various lead time intervals against the model without a steady-state Kalman filter. This shows that, even though the process model has a water level representation that is substantially better than that of other comparable operational models of this scale, substantial improvements in predictive quality in the first few hours are possible in an actual operational setting.},

abstract = {A new eddy-permitting ocean reanalysis has been recently completed at ECMWF. It is called Ocean ReAnalysis Pilot 5 (ORAP5), and it spans the period 1979–2012. This work describes the new system, evaluates its performance, and investigates how the estimation of climate indices are affected by the assimilation system settings. ORAP5 introduces several upgrades with respect to its predecessor ORAS4, including increased horizontal and vertical resolution, an prognostic sea-ice component, new versions of the ocean and data assimilation system, revised surface fluxes, new version and treatment of satellite sea surface height data, and assimilation of sea-ice concentration, among others. ORAP5 shows similar performance to ORAS4, with improvements in the northern extratropics (especially in salinity), and slight degradation in the Southern Ocean, probably because the observations are insufficient to constrain the increased level of variability in ORAP5. The sensitivity experiments show that superobbing of altimeter data and correlation length-scales of the background errors have a visible impact on the time evolution of global steric height and its partition into thermo/halo-steric contributions. The sensitivities are especially large in the pre-Argo period, when there is the risk of producing unrealistic steric height variations by overfitting the altimeter data. Compared with a control run without data assimilation, all the assimilation experiments also show stronger variability in the halosteric component in the pre-Argo period. The results highlight the importance of sub-surface observations to assist the assimilation of altimeter data, and the need of using a variety of metrics for evaluating ocean reanalysis systems.},

abstract = {Populations and property values are increasing in tropical cyclone prone regions, driving up repair and replacement costs following a tropical cyclone impact. Climate change influences on tropical cyclones and sea levels will only exacerbate these rises. For example, Australia's Severe Tropical Cyclone Debbie in 2017 was one of the most destructive cyclones to make landfall in Australia since Tropical Cyclone Tracy in 1974. The primary impacts of Cyclone Debbie were due to extreme short duration intense wind driven rainfall and widespread major flooding, both linked to uncharacteristically warm sea surface temperatures. Studying the impact of climate change on tropical cyclones is limited by the lack of well observed historical events. Traditional hazard risk assessment approaches are limited since they are primarily based on statistical models which only deal with single meteorological hazards, or use simplified parameterized relationships when more than one phenomenon is included. Here we explore the value of dynamical models for creating targeted, detailed, and physically plausible multi-hazard tropical cyclone scenarios, through the development of a modeling system that i) retains a high degree of simulation control, ii) is globally applicable, and iii) is responsive to climate variability and change. Application of the modeling system to a thermodynamic climate change scenario finds that the tropical cyclone penetrates much further inland with a marked expansion of the heavy rainfall area, resulting in significantly larger areas subjected to damaging and destructive wind speeds and rainfall totals capable of producing flash and riverine flooding.},

A hybrid numerical model coupling wind large-eddy (LES) and high-order spectral-wave simulations is employed to capture the effects of ocean swell waves on offshore wind. In the simulation, 3 × 3 floating wind turbines with prescribed pitch motions were modeled using the actuator disk model. The turbulence statistics and wind-power extraction rate for the floating turbines are quantified and compared to a reference case with fixed turbines. Statistical analysis based on the phase-average approach shows significant swell-correlated wind-velocity variations in both cases, and the swell-induced pitch motion of floating turbines is found to cause oscillations of wind-turbulence intensity and Reynolds stress, as well as an increase of vertical velocity variance in the near-wake region. Swells also cause periodic oscillation in extracted power density in the fixed turbine case, and the turbine pitch motion in the floating turbine case could further modulate this oscillation by shifting the phase dependence by about 180 degrees with respect to the swell-wave phase.},

abstract = {Coastal inundation by storm surges is one of the main risks for coastal cities worldwide. These risks are expected to further increase in the next few decades due to population growth, sea level rise and land subsidence. To assist worldwide advance warning, a global operational forecasting system with a global storm surge model is developed. The global model uses an unstructured spherical grid, to represent coastal areas in more detail (around 5 km resolution) than open oceans (50 km resolution), with in total nearly 1 million computation cells. The newly developed highly efficient Delft3D flexible mesh code produces a 10 day forecast within 30 minutes on just one 12core Intel E5 computational node. The model was calibrated and validated against about 300 coastal tide gauges and satellite altimeter. The main goals of the model are to provide boundary conditions for nested more detailed regional models and to study the impact of climate change. The Global Storm Surge Forecasting and Information System (GLOSSIS) is developed with Delft-FEWS, the proven real time data centric software infrastructure for operational water management and forecasting. The system manages all data flows, such as real-time observations and global meteorological forcing of the model, as well as scheduling model runs and visualisation of the results. Model output is produced for about 16,000 coastal segments with more or less homogeneous characteristics (DIVA). This can be compared against hundreds of real-time observations from tide-gauges worldwide, imported from the IOC sea level station monitoring facility. The system provides real-time operational water level and storm-surge forecasts in areas that currently lack any forecasting capability. Currently, the model is running 4 times a day to produce update forecasts of coastal storm surges worldwide.},

abstract = {This is the first of a two-part investigation of a coupled wind and wave model that includes the enhanced form drag of breaking waves. In Part I here the model is developed and applied to mature seas. Part II explores the solutions in a wide range of wind and wave conditions, including growing seas. Breaking and nonbreaking waves induce air-side fluxes of momentum and energy above the air-sea interface. By balancing air-side momentum and energy and by conserving wave energy, coupled nonlinear advance-delay differential equations are derived, which govern simultaneously the wave and wind field. The system of equations is closed by introducing a relation between the wave height spectrum and wave dissipation due to breaking. The wave dissipation is proportional to nonlinear wave interactions, if the wave curvature spectrum is below the "threshold saturation level." Above this threshold the wave dissipation rapidly increases so that the wave height spectrum is limited. The coupled model is applied to mature wind-driven seas for which the wind forcing only occurs in the equilibrium range away from the spectral peak. Modeled wave height curvature spectra as functions of wavenumber $\kappa$ are consistent with observations and transition from $\kappa$1/2 at low wavenumbers to $\kappa$ 0 at high wavenumbers. Breaking waves affect only weakly the wave height spectrum. Furthermore, the wind input to waves is dominated by nonbreaking waves closer to the spectral peak. Shorter breaking waves, however, can support a significant fraction, which increases with wind speed, of the total air-sea momentum flux. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Deterministic analysis of local tsunami generated by subduction zone earthquakes demonstrates the potential for extensive inundation and building damage in Napier, New Zealand. We present the first high-resolution assessments of tsunami inundation in Napier based on full simulation from tsunami generation to inundation and demonstrate the potential variability of onshore impacts due to local earthquakes. In the most extreme scenario, rupture of the whole Hikurangi subduction margin, maximum onshore flow depth exceeds 8.0 m within 200 m of the shore and exceeds 5.0 m in the city centre, with high potential for major damage to buildings. Inundation due to single-segment or splay fault rupture is relatively limited despite the magnitudes of MW 7.8 and greater. There is approximately 30 min available for evacuation of the inundation zone following a local rupture, and inundation could reach a maximum extent of 4 km. The central city is inundated by up to three waves, and Napier Port could be inundated repeatedly for 12 h. These new data on potential flow depth, arrival time and flow kinematics provide valuable information for tsunami education, exposure analysis and evacuation planning. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

We performed a validation study for Hurricane Ike (2008) to prove the accuracy of the updated model against satellite altimeter data and buoy observations on various grids, forced by two sophisticated atmospheric models for hurricane simulation, using different solution schemes and parallelization algorithms. The new implementations for triangular grids are computationally efficient and scalable to be run on a large number of computational nodes, which constitutes a major breakthrough in the context of increasing needs for high-resolution nearshore wave modeling, making WAVEWATCH III (WW3) a powerful tool to simulate the sea state in the nearshore at high resolution and study wave-surge interactions in inner shelf regions.},

abstract = {In this paper, a two-dimensional multi-scale turbulence model is proposed to study breaking waves. The purpose of developing this model is to produce a relatively accurate model with moderate computer requirements. The free surface is tracked by the VOF technique, the log-law profile for the mean velocity is applied at the bottom. Comparing with the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes models (RANS), the present model shows improving agreement with experimental measurements in terms of surface elevations, particle velocities, wave height distributions and undertow profiles. The subgrid scale (SGS) turbulent transport mechanism is also discussed in the paper. It is found that turbulent production and dissipation are of the same order, but turbulent production is primarily located at the wavefront and above the wave trough, whereas turbulent dissipation is primarily located at the back face of a wave, indicating that in these regions, the assumption of equilibrium is not correct. Below the trough level, the local equilibrium assumption is reasonable. Turbulent convection and diffusion are of the same order at the trough level. Above the trough level, turbulent convection dominates. Under the spilling breaking wave, turbulent kinetic energy is continue to dissipate in the bore region, whereas under the plunging breaking wave, the turbulent kinetic energy is dissipated very rapidly within one wave period.},

The field data included visual observations of watermarks, which were located via handheld GPS units and then photographed. Where possible, watermarks were surveyed along cross-shore profiles to determine runup height. Additional information on wave arrival and behavior—including the timing and the number of waves—was collected through interviews with witnesses and survivors and from video recorded during the tsunami event. These data were used in conjunction with satellite imagery obtained before and shortly after the earthquake to describe the effects of the tsunami and earthquake in terms of runup height, inundation distance, flow depth, levels of structural damage, shoreline erosion, and earthquake-related subsidence. This data set is far from complete, and additional information is needed to fully assess the tsunami effects in northern Sumatra.},

@article{Blain1998,
abstract = {The focus of this paper is a systematic determination of the relationship between grid resolution and errors associated with computations of hurricane storm surge. A grid structure is sought that provides the spatial resolution necessary to capture pertinent storm surge physics and does not overdiscretize. A set of numerical experiments simulating storm surge generation over 14 grid discretizations of idealized domains examines the influence of grid spacing, shoreline detail, coastline resolution and characteristics of the meteorological forcing on storm surge computations. Errors associated with a given grid are estimated using a Richardson-based error estimator. Analysis of the magnitude and location of estimated errors indicates that underresolution on the continental shelf leads to significant overproduction of the primary storm surge. In deeper waters, underresolution causes smearing or damping of the inverted barometer forcing function, which in turn results in underprediction of the surge elevation. In order to maintain a specified error level throughout the duration of the storm, the highest grid resolution is required on the continental shelf and particularly in nearshore areas. The disparity of discretization requirements between deep waters and coastal regions is best met using a graded grid. Application of the graded gridding strategy to the hindcast of Hurricane Camille reinforces the necessity of using a grid that has high levels of resolution in nearshore regions and areas of complex coastal geometry. {\textcopyright} 1998 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The cyclone made landfall as a category 1 hurricane (on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale) in Jamaica, and as a 100-kt category 3 hurricane in eastern Cuba before quickly weakening to a category 1 hurricane while moving through the central and northwestern Bahamas. Sandy underwent a complex evolution and grew consid erably in size while over the Bahamas, and continued to grow despite weakening into a tropi cal storm north of those islands. The system re- strengthened into a hurricane while it moved northeastward, parallel to the coast of the southeastern United States, and reached a seconda ry peak intensity of 85 kt while it turned northwestward toward the mid-Atlantic states . Sandy weakened somewhat and then made landfall as a post-tropical cyclone near Briganti ne, New Jersey with 70-kt maximum sustained winds. Because of its tremendous size, however, Sandy drove a catastrophic storm surge into the New Jersey and New York coastlines. Prelimin ary U.S. damage estimat es are near {\$}50 billion, making Sandy the second-costliest cyclone to hit the United States since 1900 1 . There were at least 147 direct deaths 2 recorded across the Atlantic basi n due to Sandy, w ith 72 of these fatalities occurring in the mid-Atlantic and nort heastern United States. This is the greatest number of U.S. direct fatalities related to a tropical cyclone outside of the southern states since Hurricane Agnes in 1972.},

abstract = {This research investigates the flow behavior and its features in the blade's root region of a horizontal axis wind turbine by using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. Wind tunnel tests are conducted to measure the velocity field, phase-locked with the blade motion, at different azimuth angles and at different spanwise positions. The pressure distribution is obtained from PIV velocity field by solving the Navier–Stokes momentum equations. In this paper, we aim to answer two questions: (i) How is the flow behavior in the root region? (ii) How is the evolution of the root vortex? The analysis of the velocity fields shows an outboard radial flow motion in the root region and a vorticity driven inboard motion at the blade{\v{S}}s maximum chord position. As a result of this vorticity driven flow, an increase in the axial velocity close to nacelle is measured. Wake sheets are observed and further discussed in the measured velocity and vorticity distributions. The formation and evolution of the root vortices conveyed downstream by the axial velocity are analyzed through vorticity and pressure distributions. Although the azimuthal vorticity in 3D representation is showing the trailing vorticity, the tilting of the root vortex tube is observed in the axial vorticity distribution. Moreover, the radial vorticity and azimuthal velocity from chordwisemeasurements show separation on the suction surface of the blade. This research concluded that the flow in the blade wake is driven by the root vortex; hence, the local effects of the root vortex cannot be ignored.},

abstract = {Renewable energy is the cornerstone of preventing dangerous climate change whilst maintaining a robust energy supply. Tidal energy will arguably play a critical role in the renewable energy portfolio as it is both predictable and reliable, and can be put in place across the globe. However, installation may impact the local and regional ecology via changes in tidal dynamics, sediment transport pathways or bathymetric changes. In order to mitigate these effects, tidal energy devices need to be modelled, to predict hydrodynamic changes. Robust mesh generation is a fundamental component required for developing simulations with high accuracy. However, mesh generation for coastal domains can be an elaborate procedure. Here, we describe an approach combining mesh generators with Geographical Information Systems. We demonstrate robustness and efficiency by constructing a mesh with which to examine the potential environmental impact of a tidal turbine farm installation in the Orkney Islands. The mesh is then used with two well-validated ocean models, to compare their flow predictions with and without a turbine array. The results demonstrate that it is possible to create an easy-to-use tool to generate high-quality meshes for combined coastal engineering, here tidal turbines, and coastal ocean simulations.},

One of the key challenges of this type of wave model, however, is to minimize the wave re-reflection from the incident boundary. Many numerical techniques have been developed to deal with this problem, and previous studies have reported on internal wave makers that employ NSE. Research on generation and transformation of irregular waves using a three-dimensional NSE model, however, has begun very recently, and few studies have yet been reported. In this study, a three-dimensional numerical model was applied to generate irregular waves, and transformation of irregular waves was simulated in a numerical wave tank. The model was first verified by applying it to simple numerical tests in two dimensions. The model was then used to generate directional monochromatic and irregular waves in three dimensions. The numerical results were compared with the analytical solutions, and good agreement was observed. Finally, the model was applied to simulate the transformation of irregular waves over an uneven bottom geometry in a wave tank.},

abstract = {Estuarine regions can experience compound impacts from coastal storm surge and riverine flooding. The challenges in forecasting flooding in such areas are multi-faceted due to uncertainties associated with meteorological drivers and interactions between hydrological and coastal processes. The objective of this work is to evaluate how uncertainties from meteorological predictions propagate through an ensemble-based flood prediction framework and translate into uncertainties in simulated inundation extents. A multi-scale framework, consisting of hydrologic, coastal and hydrodynamic models, was used to simulate two extreme flood events at the confluence of the Passaic and Hackensack rivers and Newark Bay. The events were Hurricane Irene (2011), a combination of inland flooding and coastal storm surge, and Hurricane Sandy (2012) where coastal storm surge was the dominant component. The hydrodynamic component of the framework was first forced with measured streamflow and ocean water level data to establish baseline inundation extents with the best available forcing data. The coastal and hydrologic models were then forced with meteorological predictions from 21 ensemble members of the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) to retrospectively represent potential future conditions up to 96 hours prior to the events. Inundation extents produced by the hydrodynamic model, forced with the 95th percentile of the ensemble-based coastal and hydrologic boundary conditions, were in good agreement with baseline conditions for both events. The USGS reanalysis of Hurricane Sandy inundation extents was encapsulated between the 50th and 95th percentile of the forecasted inundation extents, and that of Hurricane Irene was similar but with caveats associated with data availability and reliability. This work highlights the importance of accounting for meteorological uncertainty to represent a range of possible future inundation extents at high resolution (∼m).},

abstract = {Proudman resonance is a primary amplification mechanism for meteotsunamis, which are shallow-water waves generated by atmospheric forcings. The effect of tides, sloping bathymetry and the speed, amplitude and aspect ratio of the atmospheric forcing on Proudman resonant wave growth are investigated using analytical approximations and numerical models. With tides included, maximum wave growth through Proudman resonance occurred when the atmospheric-forcing speed matched the tidal-wave speed. Growth greater than Proudman resonance occurred with a positive tidal elevation together with a tidal current in the opposite direction to wave propagation, due to linear growth combined with further amplification from wave-flux conservation. Near-Proudman resonant growth occurred when the forced-wave speed or free-wave speed varied by either a small amount, or varied rapidly, around a speed appropriate for Proudman resonance. For a forcing moving at Proudman resonant speed, resultant wave growth was proportional to the total, time-integrated forcing amplitude. Finally, Proudman resonant wave growth was lower for forcings with lower aspect ratios (AP), partly because forced-wave heights are proportional to 1 + AP2, but also because free waves could spread in two dimensions. Whilst the assumptions of strict Proudman resonance are never met, near-Proudman resonant growth may occur over hundreds of kilometres if the effective Froude number is near 1 and the resultant wave propagates predominantly in one dimension.},

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical study of the boundary layer flow and properties induced by tsunami-scale waves. For this purpose, an existing one-dimensional vertical (1DV) boundary layer model, based on the horizontal component of the incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations, is newly extended to incorporate a transitional variant of the standard two-equation k–$\omega$ turbulence closure. The developed numerical model is successfully validated against recent experimental measurements involving transient solitary wave boundary layers as well as for oscillatory flows, collectively demonstrating the ability to reproduce accurate velocity profiles, turbulence, and bed shear stresses on both smooth and rough beds. The validated model is then employed for the study of transient wave boundary layers at full tsunami scales, covering a wide and realistic geophysical range in terms of the flow duration, bottom roughness, and associated Reynolds numbers. For this purpose, three different “synthetic” (idealised) tsunami wave descriptions are considered i.e., invoking: (1) single wave (solitary-like, but with independent period and wave height), (2) sinusoidal, and (3) N-wave descriptions. The flow, boundary layer thickness, turbulence, and bed shear stresses induced are systematically monitored and parameterised, under both hydraulically smooth and rough bed conditions. The results generally support a notion that the boundary layers induced by tsunami-scale waves are both current-like, due to their long durations, as well as wave-like, in the sense that the boundary layer will not necessarily span the entirety of the water column. The results likewise suggest that there is a continuum connecting wind-wave and tsunami-wave scales, as existing expressions commonly used for characterising boundary layer properties beneath wind-waves maintain reasonable accuracy when extrapolated to full tsunami scales. Boundary layers driven by actual field-measured tsunami signals are likewise simulated, stemming from both the 2004 Indian Ocean as well as the 2011 Tohoku events. These results are reconciled with the various synthetic tsunami signals considered, generally confirming their usefulness as idealised tsunami waves.},

abstract = {This study examines the implications of recent advances in global climate modelling for simulating storm surges. Following the ERA-Interim (0.75° × 0.75°) global climate reanalysis, in 2018 the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts released its successor, the ERA5 (0.25° × 0.25°) reanalysis. Using the Global Tide and Surge Model, we analyse eight historical storm surge events driven by tropical—and extra-tropical cyclones. For these events we extract wind fields from the two reanalysis datasets and compare these against satellite-based wind field observations from the Advanced SCATterometer. The root mean squared errors in tropical cyclone wind speed reduce by 58{\%} in ERA5, compared to ERA-Interim, indicating that the mean sea-level pressure and corresponding strong 10-m winds in tropical cyclones greatly improved from ERA-Interim to ERA5. For four of the eight historical events we validate the modelled storm surge heights with tide gauge observations. For Hurricane Irma, the modelled surge height increases from 0.88 m with ERA-Interim to 2.68 m with ERA5, compared to an observed surge height of 2.64 m. We also examine how future advances in climate modelling can potentially further improve global storm surge modelling by comparing the results for ERA-Interim and ERA5 against the operational Integrated Forecasting System (0.125° × 0.125°). We find that a further increase in model resolution results in a better representation of the wind fields and associated storm surges, especially for small size tropical cyclones. Overall, our results show that recent advances in global climate modelling have the potential to increase the accuracy of early-warning systems and coastal flood hazard assessments at the global scale.},

abstract = {Previous studies investigating the impacts of climate change on extratropical cyclones have primarily focused on changes in the frequency, intensity, and distribution of these events. Fewer studies have directly investigated changes in the storm-scale dynamics of individual cyclones. Precipitation associated with these events is projected to increase with warming owing to increased atmospheric water vapor content. This presents the potential for enhancement of cyclone intensity through increased lower-tropospheric diabatic potential vorticity generation. This hypothesis is tested using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model to simulate individual wintertime extratropical cyclone events along the United States East Coast in present-day and future thermodynamic environments. Thermodynamic changes derived from an ensemble of GCMs for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) A2 emissions scenario are applied to analyzed initial and lateral boundary conditions of observed strongly developing cyclone events, holding relative humidity constant. The perturbed boundary conditions are then used to drive future simulations of these strongly developing events. Present-to-future changes in the storm-scale dynamics are assessed using Earth-relative and storm-relative compositing. Precipitation increases at a rate slightly less than that dictated by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation with warming. Increases in cyclone intensity are seen in the form of minimum sea level pressure decreases and a strengthened 10-m wind field. Amplification of the low-level jet occurs because of the enhancement of latent heating. Storm-relative potential vorticity diagnostics indicate a strengthening of diabatic potential vorticity near the cyclone center, thus supporting the hypothesis that enhanced latent heat release is responsible for this regional increase in future cyclone intensity.},

abstract = {Developing surrogate geophysical models from data is a key research topic in atmospheric and oceanic modeling because of the large computational costs associated with numerical simulation methods. Researchers have started applying a wide range of machine learning models, in particular neural networks, to geophysical data for forecasting without these constraints. However, constructing neural networks for forecasting such data is nontrivial and often requires trial and error. To that end, we focus on developing proper-orthogonal-decomposition-based long short-term memory networks (POD-LSTMs). We develop a scalable neural architecture search for generating stacked LSTMs to forecast temperature in the NOAA Optimum Interpolation Sea-Surface Temperature data set. Our approach identifies POD-LSTMs that are superior to manually designed variants and baseline time-series prediction methods. We also assess the scalability of different architecture search strategies on up to 512 Intel Knights Landing nodes of the Theta supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility.},

abstract = {An immersed boundary method for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in irregular domains is developed using a local ghost cell approach. This method extends the solution smoothly across the boundary in the same direction as the discretization it will be used for. The ghost cell value is determined locally for each irregular grid cell, making it possible to treat both sharp corners and thin plates accurately. The time stepping is done explicitly using a second order Runge–Kutta method. The spatial derivatives are approximated by finite difference methods on a staggered, Cartesian grid with local grid refinements near the immersed boundary. The WENO scheme is used to treat the convective terms, while all other terms are discretized with central schemes. It is demonstrated that the spatial accuracy of the present numerical method is second order. Further, the method is tested and validated for a number of problems including uniform flow past a circular cylinder, impulsively started flow past a circular cylinder and a flat plate, and planar oscillatory flow past a circular cylinder and objects with sharp corners, such as a facing square and a chamfered plate.},

abstract = {Abstract A computationally efficient relocatable system for generalized inverse (GI) modeling of barotropic ocean tides is described. The GI penalty functional is minimized using a representer method, which requires repeated solution of the forward and adjoint linearized shallow water equations (SWEs). To make representer computations efficient, the SWEs are solved in the frequency domain by factoring the coefficient matrix for a finite-difference discretization of the second-order wave equation in elevation. Once this matrix is factored representers can be calculated rapidly. By retaining the first-order SWE system (defined in terms of both elevations and currents) in the definition of the discretized GI penalty functional, complete generality in the choice of dynamical error covariances is retained. This allows rational assumptions about errors in the SWE, with soft momentum balance constraints (e.g., to account for inaccurate parameterization of dissipation), but holds mass conservation constraints.

One parameter is a multiplicative factor that amplifies or attenuates the drag coefficient for all wind speeds, the second is the maximum wind speed at which drag coefficient saturation occurs, and the third is the drag coefficient's rate of change with increasing wind speed after saturation. Bayesian inference provides optimal estimates of the parameters as well as a non-Gaussian probability distribution characterizing the uncertainty of these estimates.

Validation shows that there is good agreement between modelled and observed sea levels, and that the perfor-mance of GTSR is similar to that of many regional hydrodynamic models. Due to the limited resolution of the meteorological forcing, extremes are slightly underestimated. This particularly affects tropical cyclones, which requires further research.

A partial differential equation for incremental pressure is used in each time-advancing scheme. Example flows considered are a polar cavity flow starting from rest and self-sustained oscillatory flows over a circular and a square cylinder. For a large time-step size, the SMAC and ITA schemes are more strongly convergent and yield more accurate results than the PISO scheme. The SMAC scheme is the most efficient computationally. For a small time-step size, the three time-advancing schemes yield equally accurate Strouhal numbers. The capability of each time-advancing scheme to accurately resolve unsteady flows is attributed to the use of a new pressure correction algorithm that can strongly enforce the conservation of mass. The numerical results show that the low frequency of the vortex shedding is caused by the growth time of each vortex shed into the wake region.},

In particular, so-called self-attraction and loading (SAL) effects caused by the redistribution of mass within the land–atmosphere–ocean system can have a measurable impact on sea level. In this study, the nature of SAL-induced variability in sea level is examined in terms of its equilibrium (static) and nonequilibrium (dynamic) components, using a general circulation model that implicitly includes the physics of SAL. The additional SAL forcing is derived by decomposing ocean mass anomalies into spherical harmonics and then applying Love numbers to infer associated crustal displacements and gravitational shifts. This implementation of SAL physics incurs only a relatively small computational cost. Effects of SAL on sea level amount to about 10{\%} of the applied surface loading on average but depend str...},

abstract = {We investigate the impact of climate change on the storm surges induced by extratropical cyclones (ETCs) between November and March. We quantify changes to the storm surge between a historical period (1979–2004) and a future period during the mid to late twenty-first century (2054–2079) for a number of major coastal cities in the Northeastern United States. Observed water levels are analyzed to estimate storm surges induced by ETCs during the historical period. A hydrodynamic model is utilized to simulate storm surges induced by ETCs projected for the future climate by seven global climate models. The biases in the hydrodynamic and climate models are calculated and removed from the simulated surge heights. Statistical methods, including the peaks-over-threshold method, are applied to estimate the storm surge return levels. We find that future projections based on most of the climate models indicate relatively small effects of climate change on ETC storm surges. The weighted-average projections over all climate models show a small increase in storm surge return levels (less than 7{\%} increase in 10- and 50-year surge heights). However, uncertainties exist among the climate models and projections from one climate model show a substantial increase in the storm surge return levels (up to 27{\%} and 36{\%} increase in 10- and 50-year surge heights, respectively). These uncertainties, and likely the larger impact of sea level rise, should be accounted for in projecting the risk posted by ETC flooding.},

abstract = {The 2011 Great East Japan Tsunami exposed many hidden weaknesses in Japan's tsunami countermeasures. Since then, many improvements have been made in both structural mea- sures (numerical simulations, coastal defense structures, building damage assessment and control forests) and nonstructural measures (warning/observation and evacuation). This review summarizes the lessons and improvements in the five-year time period after the 2011 event. After five years, most of the lessons from the 2011 tsunami have been applied, including more realistic tsunami simulations using very fine grids, methods to strengthen coastal defense structures, building evacuations and coastal forests, improved warning con- tent and key points to improve evacuation measures. Nevertheless, large future challenges remain, such as an advanced simulation technique and system for real-time hazard and risk prediction, implementation of coastal defense structures/multilayer countermeasures and encouraging evacuation. In addition, among papers presented at the coastal engineering conference in Japan, the proportion of tsunami-related research in Japan increased from 15{\%} to 35{\%} because of the 2011 tsunami, and approximately 65–70{\%} of tsunami-related studies involve numerical simulation, coastal structures and building damage. These results show the impact of the 2011 tsunami on coastal engineering related to academic institutions and consulting industries in Japan as well as the interest in each tsunami countermeasure.

The vertical structure permits as dependent variables the horizontal wind at two internal levels and a single temperature, with the static stability entering as a parameter. The incoming radiation is a function of latitude only corresponding to the annual mean, and the outgoing radiation is taken to be a function of the local temperature. With the requirement for thermal equilibrium, the domain mean temperature is specified as a parameter.

abstract = {Future projections of extreme ocean surface wave climates were carried out with single-model ensemble experiments of the atmospheric global climate model MRI-AGCM3.2H. The ensemble experiments of MRI-AGCM3.2H consist of four future sea surface temperature (SST) ensembles and three perturbed physics (PP) ensembles. This study showed that future changes in extreme wave heights strongly depend on the global climate model (GCM) performance to simulate tropical cyclones (TCs), indicating a need to acknowledge that results in a study that employs a low-performance model are not able to account for extreme waves associated with TCs (TC waves). The spatial distribution of future changes in non-TC extreme wave heights on the global scale was similar to that for mean wave heights; namely, wave heights increase over the middle-to-high latitudes in the Southern Ocean and central North Pacific and decrease over midlatitudes and the North Atlantic, although the magnitude of future changes for extreme wave heights is greater than for mean wave heights. The variance of future changes mainly depends on differences in physics among PP ensemble experiments rather than differences in SST ensembles. The 10-yr return wave heights of TC waves over the western North Pacific showed either an increase or a decrease of 30{\%} for different regions, maximally. The spatial distribution of future changes in TC waves can be explained by an eastward shift of TC tracks.},

abstract = {The largest collection of tide gauge records assembled to date, called GESLA-2, has been used to provide reliable extreme sea level parameters at 655 locations around the world. This has enabled a rigorous assessment of the European Union-funded DINAS-COAST (D-C) data set of extreme sea level information for the global coastline that has been used in many published flood impact studies. We find the D-C extreme levels to be generally both too high, compared to those from GESLA-2, and too flat, when plotted as a function of return period. This leads to an over-estimation of the probability of extreme sea levels in the present day for most locations around the world, and also to an over-estimation of the probability of extreme sea levels in the future as sea level rises. A detailed impact study is conducted for the world's largest coastal cities following the approach of Hallegatte et al. (2013), resulting in similar conclusions for these particular locations. We suggest that most previous studies that have relied upon D-C information should be re-assessed in the light of these findings, using more recent modelling-based estimates of extreme sea level information.},

The design involves an essentially non-oscillatory piecewise polynomial reconstruction of the solution from its cell averages, time evolution through an approximate solution of the resulting initial value problem, and averaging of this approximate solution over each cell. The reconstruction algorithm is derived from a new interpolation technique that, when applied to piecewise smooth data, gives high-order accuracy whenever the function is smooth but avoids a Gibbs phenomenon at discontinuities. Unlike standard finite difference methods this procedure uses an adaptive stencil of grid points and, consequently, the resulting schemes are highly nonlinear.},

We combine recent observations from pressure gauges and ADCPs on fixed platforms and additional short-term deployments off the Georgia and South Carolina coasts together with National Ocean Service coastal tidal elevation harmonics. These data have shed light on the regional tidal propagation, particularly off the Georgia/South Carolina coast, which is perforated by a dense estuary/tidal inlet complex (ETIC). We have computed tidal solutions for the western North Atlantic Ocean on two model domains. One includes a first-order representation of the ETIC in the SAB, and the other does not include the ETIC. We find that the ETIC is highly dissipative and affects the regional energy balance of the semidiurnal tides. Nearshore, inner, and midshelf model skill at semidiurnal frequencies is sensitive to the inclusion of the ETIC. The numerical solution that includes the ETIC shows significantly improved skill compared to the solution that does not include the ETIC. For the M2 constituent, the largest tidal frequency in the SAB, overall amplitude and phase error is reduced from 0.25 m to 0.03 m and 13.8° to 2.8° for coastal observation stations. Similar improvement is shown for midshelf stations. Diurnal tides are relatively unaffected by the ETIC.},

Based on four experiments (simulated by UU-CM, Uppsala University-Coupled model) with four different coupling configurations between atmosphere, waves, and ocean, we found that the simulations of the wind power density (WPD) and wave potential energy (WPE) are sensitive to the AWO interaction processes over the North and Baltic Seas; in particular, to the atmosphere-ocean coupling processes. Adding all coupling processes can change more than 25{\%} of the WPE but only less than 5{\%} of the WPD in four chosen coastal areas. The impact of the AWO coupling processes on the WPE and WPD changes significantly with the distance off the shoreline, and the influences vary with regions.

abstract = {A hybrid numerical capability is developed for the simulation of offshore wind farms, in which large-eddy simulation is performed for the wind turbulence, and a potential flow based method is used for the simulation of the ocean wave field. The wind and wave simulations are dynamically coupled. The effect of wind turbines on the wind field is represented by an actuator disk model. This study focuses on the effect of wind-seas, and the turbine motion is treated as negligibly small. A variety of fullydeveloped and fetch-limited wind-sea conditions and turbine spacings are considered in the study. Statistical analyses are performed for the simulation results, with a focus on the mean wind profile, kinetic energy budget in the wind field, and the wind turbine power extraction rate. The results indicate that the waves have appreciable effect on the wind farm performance. The wind turbines obtain a higher wind power extraction rate under the fully developed wind-sea condition compared with that under the fetch-limited condition. This higher extraction rate is caused by the faster propagating waves and the lower sea-surface resistance on the wind when the windseas are fully developed. The wave-induced difference can be as high as 8{\%} with the commonly used turbine spacing in commercial land-based wind farms, sx = 7 (with sx being the ratio of streamwise turbine spacing to the turbine diameter). Such level of difference is noteworthy considering the previous understanding that direct wave-induced disturbance to the wind field decays exponentially away from wave surface. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {Abstract Two methods to assess ocean tide models, the current method and the total discrepancy method, are compared from the perspective of their relationship to the root mean square difference of tidal sea surface height (total discrepancy). These two methods are identically the same when there is only one spatial location involved. When there are more than one spatial locations involved, the current method is the root mean square of total discrepancy at each location, and the total discrepancy method is the averaged total discrepancy. The result from the current method is always larger than or equal to that from the total discrepancy method. Monte Carlo simulation indicates that the difference between their results increases with increasing spatial variability of total discrepancy. Both these two methods are then used to compare the two tide models of the Ocean Surface Topography Mission (OSTM/Jason-2). The discrepancy of these two models as measured by the total discrepancy method decreases monotonically from around 11.4 cm to 2.2 cm with depth increasing from 50 m to 1000 m. In contrast, the discrepancy measured by the current method varies from 21.6 cm to 2.9 cm. Though the discrepancy measured by the current method decreases with increasing depth in general, there are abrupt increases at several depth ranges. These increases are associated with large spatial variability of total discrepancy and their physical explanation is elusive. Since the total discrepancy method is consistent with the root mean square difference of tidal sea surface height and its interpretation is straightforward, its usage is suggested.},

abstract = {This study investigates the future change in precipitation associated with extratropical cyclones over eastern North America and the western Atlantic during the cool season (November-March) through the twenty-first century. A cyclone-relative approach is applied to 10 models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) in order to isolate precipitation changes for different cyclone intensities and storm life cycle, as well as determine the relevant physical processes associated with these changes. The historical analysis suggests that models with better performance in predicting extratropical cyclones tend to have smaller precipitation errors, and the ensemble mean has a smaller mean absolute error than the individual models. By the late-twenty-first century, the precipitation amount associated with cyclones increases by 5{\%}-25{\%} over the U.S. East Coast, with about 90{\%} of the increase from the relatively strong ({\textless} 990 hPa) and moderate (990-1005 hPa) cyclones. Meanwhile, the precipitation rate increases by 15{\%}-25{\%} over the U.S. East Coast for the strong cyclone centers, which is larger than the moderate and weak cyclones. The relatively strong cyclones just inland of the U.S. East Coast have the largest increase ({\~{}}30{\%}) in precipitation rate, since these centers over land have the largest increase in low-level temperature (and moisture), a decrease (5{\%}-13{\%}) in the static stability, and an increase ({\~{}}5{\%}) in upward motion during the late-twenty-first century. This east coast region also has an increase in cyclone intensity in the future even though there is a decrease in low-level baroclinicity, which suggests that the latent heat release from heavier precipitation contributes to this storm deepening.},

abstract = {The resonances of tides in the coupled open ocean and shelf are modeled by a mechanical analogue consisting of a damped driven larger mass and spring (the open-ocean) connected to a damped smaller mass and spring (the shelf). When both masses are near resonance, the addition of even a very small mass can significantly affect the oscillations of the larger mass. The influence of the shelf is largest if the shelf is resonant with weak friction. In particular, an increase of friction on a near-resonant shelf can, perhaps surprisingly, lead to an increase in ocean tides. On the other hand, a shelf with large friction has little effect on ocean tides. Comparison of the model predictions with results from numerical models of tides during the ice ages, when lower sea levels led to a much reduced areal extent of shelves, suggests that the predicted larger tidal dissipation then is related to the ocean basins being close to resonance. New numerical simulations with a forward global tide model are used to test expectations from the mechanical analogue. Setting friction to unrealistically large values in Hudson Strait yields larger North Atlantic M2 amplitudes, very similar to those seen in a simulation with the Hudson Strait blocked off. Thus, as anticipated, a shelf with very large friction is nearly equivalent in its effect on the open ocean to the removal of the shelf altogether. Setting friction in shallow waters throughout the globe to unrealistically large values yields even larger open ocean tidal amplitudes, similar to those found in simulations of ice-age tides. It thus appears that larger modeled tides during the ice ages can be a consequence of enhanced friction in shallower water on the shelf in glacial times as well as a reduced shelf area then. Single oscillator and coupled oscillator models for global tides show that the maximum extractable power for human use is a fraction of the present dissipation rate, which is itself a fraction of global human power consumption. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A new high-resolution Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) coupled model [the High-Resolution Forecast-Oriented Low Ocean Resolution (FLOR) model (HiFLOR)] has been developed and used to investigate potential skill in simulation and prediction of tropical cyclone (TC) activity. HiFLOR comprises high-resolution ({\~{}}25-km mesh) atmosphere and land components and a more moderate-resolution ({\~{}}100-km mesh) sea ice and ocean component. HiFLOR was developed from FLOR by decreasing the horizontal grid spacing of the atmospheric component from 50 to 25 km, while leaving most of the subgrid-scale physical parameterizations unchanged. Compared with FLOR, HiFLOR yields a more realistic simulation of the structure, global distribution, and seasonal and interannual variations of TCs, as well as a comparable simulation of storm-induced cold wakes and TC-genesis modulation induced by the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO). Moreover, HiFLOR is able to simulate and predict extremely intense TCs (Saffir-Simpson hurricane categories 4 and 5) and their interannual variations, which represents the first time a global coupled model has been able to simulate such extremely intense TCs in a multicentury simulation, sea surface temperature restoring simulations, and retrospective seasonal predictions.},

@article{Horsburgh2007,
abstract = {Storm surges are the sea level response to meteorological conditions. Scientists and engineers need to understand the interaction of surges with the tide in order to provide better estimates of extreme sea level for use in coastal defense. Using data from five tide gauges, spaced equally along the North Sea coastline around the UK, we show that the mode of peak residual occurrence is everywhere 3 to 5 hours before the nearest high water. We reveal a previously unobserved mode that falls 1 to 2 hours prior to high water, although this cluster is not associated with the highest residuals. A simple mathematical explanation for surge clustering on the rising tide is presented. The phase shift of the tidal signal is combined with the modulation of surge production due to water depth in a model that provides a good description of the residual data set. The results contain several features of interest for flood risk management. We show that large, locally generated surges are precluded close to high water. For physically realistic arrival times of any travelling surge component, the residual peak will avoid high water for any finite tidal phase shift. Furthermore, increasing the tidal range reduces the risk of residual peaks near high water. We draw attention to the existence of critical time and space scales for surge development and decay. For reliable operational forecasts of sea level, coastal numerical models need to reproduce both tides and surges with improved accuracy. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Free-decay tests for rigid-body degrees of freedom (DOF) in still water and hydrodynamic tests for a regular wave are performed to validate the numerical model by inputting gross system parameters supported in the Offshore Code Comparison, Collaboration, Continued, with Correlations (OC5) project. A full-configuration FOWT simulation, with the simultaneous motion of the rotating blade due to 6-DOF platform dynamics, was performed. A relatively heavy load on the hub and blade was observed for the FOWT compared with the onshore wind turbine, leading to a 7.8{\%} increase in the thrust curve; a 10{\%} decrease in the power curve was also observed for the floating-type turbines, which could be attributed to the smaller project area and relative wind speed required for the rotor to receive wind power when the platform pitches. Finally, the tower-blade interference effects, blade-tip vortices, turbulent wakes, and shedding vortices in the fluid domain with relatively complex unsteady flow conditions were observed and investigated in detail.},

abstract = {The steep offshore slope and abrupt transition to a shallow lagoon are conducive to formation of energetic breaking waves in fringing reef environments. This paper describes an extension of a one-dimensional, shock-capturing Boussinesq-type model to account for these processes in two dimensions and the numerical formulation to facilitate adaptive time integration and code parallelization. The governing equations contain the conservative form of the nonlinear shallow-water equations to capture shock-related hydraulic processes. The finite volume method with a Godunov-type scheme provides a compatible, conservative numerical procedure. A two-dimensional TVD (Total Variation Diminishing) reconstruction procedure evaluates the flow variables on either side of the cell interface, while a Riemann solver supplies the flux and bathymetry source terms at the interface. A well-balanced scheme eliminates depth-interpolation errors in the domain and preserves continuity across moving boundaries over irregular topography. Time integration of the governing equations evaluates the conserved variables, which in turn provide the horizontal velocity components through systems of linear equations corresponding to series of one-dimensional problems. The application of the model to fringing reef environments is validated with laboratory experiments performed at Oregon State University as well as field data collected in Hawaii. The model describes the flux-dominated wave breaking processes through the Riemann solver without predefined empirical energy dissipation and reproduces transitions between sub and supercritical flows as well as development of dispersive and infra-gravity waves in the processes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Conditioning the statistics of the SGS velocity flux enhancement on 1) the fluxes associated with the resolved winds and 2) the precipitation rate, we find that the lack of a separation between ''resolved'' and ''unresolved'' scales results in a distribution of flux enhancements for each configuration of the resolved state. That is, the SGS velocity flux enhancement should be represented stochastically rather than deterministically. The spatial and temporal statistics of the SGS velocity flux enhancement are investigated by using basic descriptive statistics and through a fit to an anisotropic space-time covariance structure. Potential spatial inhomogeneities of the statistics of the SGS velocity flux enhancement are investigated through regional analysis, although because of the relatively short duration of the simulation (9 days) distinguishing true inhomogeneity from sampling variability is difficult. Perspectives for the implementation of such a stochastic parameterization in weather and climate models are discussed.},

abstract = {Explosive extratropical cyclones (EETCs) are rapidly intensifying low pressure systems that generate severe weather along North America's Atlantic coast. Global climate models (GCMs) tend to simulate too few EETCs, perhaps partly due to their coarse horizontal resolution and poorly resolved moist diabatic processes. This study explores whether dynamical downscaling can reduce EETC frequency biases, and whether this affects future projections of storms along North America's Atlantic coast. A regional climate model (CanRCM4) is forced with the CanESM2 GCM for the periods 1981 to 2000 and 2081 to 2100. EETCs are tracked from relative vorticity using an objective feature tracking algorithm. CanESM2 simulates 38{\%} fewer EETC tracks compared to reanalysis data, which is consistent with a negative Eady growth rate bias (−0.1 day- 1). Downscaling CanESM2 with CanRCM4 increases EETC frequency by one third, which reduces the frequency bias to −22{\%}, and increases maximum EETC precipitation by 22{\%}. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing is projected to decrease EETC frequency (−15{\%}, −18{\%}) and Eady growth rate (−0.2 day- 1, −0.2 day- 1), and increase maximum EETC precipitation (46{\%}, 52{\%}) in CanESM2 and CanRCM4, respectively. The limited effect of dynamical downscaling on EETC frequency projections is consistent with the lack of impact on the maximum Eady growth rate. The coarse spatial resolution of GCMs presents an important limitation for simulating extreme ETCs, but Eady growth rate biases are likely just as relevant. Further bias reductions could be achieved by addressing processes that lead to an underestimation of lower tropospheric meridional temperature gradients.},

abstract = {Storm surge and overland flooding can be predicted with computational models at high levels of resolution. To improve efficiency in forecasting applications, surge models often use atmospheric forcing from parametric vortex models, which represent the surface pressures and wind fields with a few storm parameters. The future of storm surge prediction could involve real-time coupling of surge and full-physics atmospheric models; thus, their accuracies must be understood in a real hurricane scenario. The authors compare predictions from a parametric vortex model (using forecast tracks from the National Hurricane Center) and a full-physics coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean model during Hurricane Isaac (2012). The predictions are then applied within a tightly coupled, wave and surge modeling system describing the northern Gulf of Mexico and the floodplains of southwest Louisiana. It is shown that, in a hindcast scenario, a parametric vortex model can outperform a data-assimilated wind product, and given reasonable forecast advisories, a parametric vortex model gives reasonable surge forecasts. However, forecasts using a full-physics coupled model outperformed the forecast advisories and improved surge forecasts. Both approaches are valuable for forecasting the coastal impacts associated with tropical cyclones.},

abstract = {Numerical modeling of sediment transport on the Sendai Plain in northeast Japan, which was caused by the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami, was performed to investigate why onshore tsunami deposits included small amounts of marine materials and to explain the gap between the maximum inland extent of the recognizable sand layer and the limit of inundation. The simulation results generally corresponded with the thicknesses of the deposits observed in the field by previous studies. The simulation revealed that the tsunami caused a significant amount of erosion on the beach and in the coastal forest; however, erosion was significantly limited on the offshore seafloor. In addition, the bore of the highest tsunami wave offshore limited the amount of suspended sediment due to a steep bathymetric profile of the shoreface and a moderate initial drop in water level prior to the arrival of the bore. This resulted in limited suspension and shoreward advection of the sediments and a minor contribution of the seafloor sediments to the onshore tsunami deposit. Visualization of the onshore sediment transport indicated that the sediment transport was significantly affected by artificial topographic features. The flow speed and height varied across the topographic highs, and sediments were trapped on the seaward side of these highs. In coastal areas, the sediment supply was limited due to the presence of engineered dikes along the coast. In inland areas, embankments of paved roadways caused increased deposition on the seaward sides of the embankments and less deposition on the leeward sides of the embankments. Although some aspects of the relevant physics were not fully implemented in the model, in which uncertainties exist, the results may explain the processes and consequences of sedimentation from a tsunami event.},

abstract = {A combination of turbulence-resolving large-eddy simulations and observations are used to examine the influence of swell amplitude and swell propagation angle on surface drag. Based on the analysis a new surface roughness parameterization with nonequilibrium wave effects is proposed. The surface roughness accounts for swell amplitude and wavelength and its relative motion with respect to the mean wind direction. The proposed parameterization is tested in uncoupled three-dimensional Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) simulations at grid sizes near 1 km where we explore potential implications of our modifications for two-way coupled atmosphere-wave models. Wind-wave misalignment likely explains the large scatter in observed nondimensional surface roughness under swell-dominated conditions. Andreas et al.'s relationship between friction velocity and the 10-m wind speed under predicts the increased drag produced by misaligned winds and waves. Incorporating wave-state (speed and direction) influences in parameterizations improves predictive skill. In a broad sense, these results suggest that one needs information on winds and wave state to upscale buoy measurements.},

abstract = {To support concept studies aimed at assessing offshore wind technology, we developed the specifications of a representative utility-scale multimegawatt turbine now known as the “NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine.” This wind turbine is a conventional three-bladed upwind variable-speed variable blade-pitch-to-feather-controlled turbine. To create the model, we obtained some broad design information from the published documents of turbine manufacturers, with a heavy emphasis on the REpower 5M machine. Because detailed data was unavailable, however, we also used the publicly available properties from the conceptual models in the WindPACT, RECOFF, and DOWEC projects. We then created a composite from these data, extracting the best available and most representative specifications. This report documents the specifications of the NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine—including the aerodynamic, structural, and control-system properties—and the rationale behind its development. The model has been, and will likely continue to be, used as a reference by research teams throughout the world to standardize baseline offshore wind turbine specifications and to quantify the benefits of advanced land- and sea-based wind energy technologies.},

abstract = {Wind farm design primarily depends on the variability of the wind turbine wake flows to the atmospheric wind conditions, and the interaction between wakes. Physics-based models that capture the wake flow-field with high-fidelity are computationally very expensive to perform layout optimization of wind farms, and, thus, data-driven reduced order models can represent an efficient alternative for simulating wind farms. In this work, we use real-world light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements of wind-turbine wakes to construct predictive surrogate models using machine learning. Specifically, we first demonstrate the use of deep autoencoders to find a low-dimensional $\backslash$emph{\{}latent{\}} space that gives a computationally tractable approximation of the wake LiDAR measurements. Then, we learn the mapping between the parameter space and the (latent space) wake flow-fields using a deep neural network. Additionally, we also demonstrate the use of a probabilistic machine learning technique, namely, Gaussian process modeling, to learn the parameter-space-latent-space mapping in addition to the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in the data. Finally, to cope with training large datasets, we demonstrate the use of variational Gaussian process models that provide a tractable alternative to the conventional Gaussian process models for large datasets. Furthermore, we introduce the use of active learning to adaptively build and improve a conventional Gaussian process model predictive capability. Overall, we find that our approach provides accurate approximations of the wind-turbine wake flow field that can be queried at an orders-of-magnitude cheaper cost than those generated with high-fidelity physics-based simulations.},

abstract = {Projections of storm-track changes over the continental United States and southern Canada made by 23 models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) have been compared to changes projected by 11 models from phase 3 of CMIP (CMIP3). Overall, under representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) forcing, CMIP5 models project much more significant decreases in North American storm-track activity than CMIP3 models under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 scenario, with the largest decrease in summer and the smallest decrease in spring. The decrease is found both in temporal variance and cyclone statistics, with the frequency of strong cyclones projected to decrease by 15.9{\%}, 6.6{\%}, 32.6{\%}, and 16.9{\%} for winter, spring, summer, and fall, respectively. There is a strong consensus among the 23 models regarding the sign of the projected change, with less than 20{\%} of the models projecting changes in the opposite sign in any of the storm-track parameters examined. Nevertheless, there are also significant model-to-model differences in the magnitude of the projected changes. Projected changes in mean flow baroclinicity have also been examined. Model-to-model differences in the projected storm-track change are found to correlate significantly with model-to-model differences in the projected change in a locally defined mean available potential energy (MAPE) across the ensemble of 34 CMIP5 and CMIP3 models, suggesting that the differences in the projected change in local MAPE can partly account for not only the model-to-model differences but also the differences between CMIP5 and CMIP3 projections. Examination of projected precipitation change suggests that models projecting larger decrease in North American storm-track activity also project a farther northward intrusion of the decrease in subtropical precipitation. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

@article{Wirasaet2015,
abstract = {In this work, we consider the application of Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) solutions to open channel flow problems, governed by two-dimensional shallow water equations (SWE), with solid curved wall boundaries on which the no-normal flow boundary conditions are prescribed. A commonly used approach consists of straightforwardly imposing the no-normal flow condition on the linear approximation of curved walls. Numerical solutions indicate clearly that this approach could lead to unfavorable results and that a proper treatment of the no-normal flow condition on curved walls is crucial for an accurate DG solution to the SWE. In the test case used, errors introduced through the commonly used approach result in artificial boundary layers of one-grid-size thickness in the velocity field and a corresponding over-prediction of the surface elevation in the upstream direction. These significant inaccuracies, which render the coarse mesh solution unreliable, appear in all DG schemes employed including those using linear, quadratic, and cubic DG polynomials. The issue can be alleviated by either using an approach accounting for errors introduced by the geometric approximation or an approach that accurately represents the geometry.},

These flood depths are combined with exposure datasets of commensurate resolution to calculate current and future flood risk. Our data show that the total US population exposed to serious flooding is 2.6–3.1 times higher than previous estimates, and that nearly 41 million Americans live within the 1{\%} annual exceedance probability floodplain (compared to only 13 million when calculated using FEMA flood maps). We find that population and GDP growth alone are expected to lead to significant future increases in exposure, and this change may be exacerbated in the future by climate change.},

abstract = {We present the Met Office Hadley Centre's sea ice and sea surface temperature (SST) data set, HadISST1, and the nighttime marine air temperature (NMAT) data set, HadMAT1. HadISST1 replaces the global sea ice and sea surface temperature (GISST) data sets and is a unique combination of monthly globally complete fields of SST and sea ice concentration on a 1° latitude-longitude grid from 1871. The companion HadMAT1 runs monthly from 1856 on a 5° latitude-longitude grid and incorporates new corrections for the effect on NMAT of increasing deck (and hence measurement) heights. HadISST1 and HadMAT1 temperatures are reconstructed using a two-stage reduced-space optimal interpolation procedure, followed by superposition of quality-improved gridded observations onto the reconstructions to restore local detail. The sea ice fields are made more homogeneous by compensating satellite microwave-based sea ice concentrations for the impact of surface melt effects on retrievals in the Arctic and for algorithm deficiencies in the Antarctic and by making the historical in situ concentrations consistent with the satellite data. SSTs near sea ice are estimated using statistical relationships between SST and sea ice concentration. HadISST1 compares well with other published analyses, capturing trends in global, hemispheric, and regional SST well, containing SST fields with more uniform variance through time and better month-to-month persistence than those in GISST. HadMAT1 is more consistent with SST and with collocated land surface air temperatures than previous NMAT data sets.},

abstract = {Variability in sea surface height (SSH) can be decomposed into two contributions: one from changes in mass in the water column (barotropic) and the other from purely steric changes (baroclinic). Both contributions can be determined from data recorded by a pressure sensor-equipped inverted echo sounder (PIES). PIES data from the Agulhas South Atlantic Thermohaline Experiment (ASTTEX) were used, collected in the Cape Basin off South Africa, along 1000 km of an eddy corridor where Agulhas eddies carry cores of warm, salty Indian Ocean waters into the South Atlantic. The paper presents in detail the method used to convert PIES measurements into barotropic, baroclinic, and total SSH, and discusses the error budget. The baroclinic contribution is geopotential height (reference 4500 dbar), which can be determined from the measured vertical acoustic travel time together with a lookup curve based on the regional hydrography. The main error source is scatter about this curve that depends on the extent to which water masses advecting along each geopotential streamline may derive from different ocean regions. The barotropic contribution can be determined from the bottom pressure measurements of the mass variation in the water column and has an uncertainty due to sensor calibration drift in two years corresponding to 1-cm water column height. The barotropic component accounts for 20{\%} of the overall SSH variance and 47{\%} during large signal intervals exceeding 15 cm. PIES data demonstrate via the two measurements that barotropic and baroclinic contributions may work independently or in concert in different mesoscale eddies. The combined structure need not be equivalent barotropic. In particular, deep barotropic eddies exhibit mesoscale spatiotemporal scales and may or may not be systematically tilted or aligned in space or time relative to baroclinic eddies. 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Coastal zones are highly dynamical systems affected by a variety of natural and anthropogenic forcing factors that include sea level rise, extreme events, local oceanic and atmospheric processes, ground subsidence, etc. However, so far, they remain poorly monitored on a global scale. To better understand changes affecting world coastal zones and to provide crucial information to decision-makers involved in adaptation to and mitigation of environmental risks, coastal observations of various types need to be collected and analyzed. In this white paper, we first discuss the main forcing agents acting on coastal regions (e.g., sea level, winds, waves and currents, river runoff, sediment supply and transport, vertical land motions, land use) and the induced coastal response (e.g., shoreline position, estuaries morphology, land topography at the land-sea interface and coastal bathymetry). We identify a number of space-based observational needs that have to be addressed in the near future to understand coastal zone evolution. Among these, improved monitoring of coastal sea level by satellite altimetry techniques is recognized as high priority. Classical altimeter data in the coastal zone are adversely affected by land contamination with degraded range and geophysical corrections. However, recent progress in coastal altimetry data processing and multi-sensor data synergy, offers new perspective to measure sea level change very close to the coast. This issue is discussed in much detail in this paper, including the development of a global coastal sea-level and sea state climate record with mission consistent coastal processing and products dedicated to coastal regimes. Finally, we present a new promising technology based on the use of Signals of Opportunity (SoOp), i.e., communication satellite transmissions that are reutilized as illumination sources in a bistatic radar configuration, for measuring coastal sea level. Since SoOp technology requires only receiver technology to be placed in orbit, small satellite platforms could be used, enabling a constellation to achieve high spatio-temporal resolutions of sea level in coastal zones.},

abstract = {Flood damage modelling has traditionally been limited to the local, regional or national scale. Recent flood events, population growth and climate change concerns have increased the need for global methods with both spatial and temporal dynamics. This paper presents a first estimation of global economic exposure to both river and coastal flooding for the period 1970-2050, using two different methods for damage assessment. One method is based on population and the second is based on land-use within areas subject to 1/100 year flood events. On the basis of population density and GDP per capita, we estimate a total global exposure to river and coastal flooding of 46 trillion USD in 2010. By 2050, these numbers are projected to increase to 158 trillion USD. Using a land-use based assessment, we estimated a total flood exposure of 27 trillion USD in 2010. For 2050 we simulate a total exposure of 80 trillion USD. The largest absolute exposure changes between 1970 and 2050 are simulated in North America and Asia. In relative terms we project the largest increases in North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. The models also show systematically larger growth in the population living within hazard zones compared to total population growth. While the methods unveil similar overall trends in flood exposure, there are significant differences in the estimates and geographical distribution. These differences result from inherent model characteristics and the varying relationship between population density and the total urban area in the regions of analysis. We propose further research on the modelling of inundation characteristics and flood protection standards, which can complement the methodologies presented in this paper to enable the development of a global flood risk framework. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A detailed energy analysis of the barotropic and baroclinic M 2 tides in the Monterey Bay area is performed. The authors first derive a theoretical framework for analyzing internal tide energetics based on the complete form of the barotropic and baroclinic energy equations, which include the full nonlinear and nonhydrostatic energy flux contributions as well as an improved evaluation of the available potential energy. This approach is implemented in the Stanford Unstructured Nonhydrostatic Terrain-Following Adaptive Navier-Stokes Simulator (SUNTANS). Results from three-dimensional, high-resolution SUNTANS simulations are analyzed to estimate the tidal energy partitioningamong generation, radiation, and dissipation. A200 km×230 km domain including all typical topographic features in this region is used to represent the Monterey Bay area. Of the 152-MWenergy lost fromthe barotropic tide, approximately 133 MW(88{\%}) is converted into baroclinic energy through internal tide generation, and 42{\%}(56 MW)of this baroclinic energy radiates away into the open ocean. The tidal energy partitioning depends greatly on the topographic features. The Davidson Seamount is most efficient at baroclinic energy generation and radiation, whereas the Monterey Submarine Canyon acts as an energy sink. Energy flux contributions from nonlinear and nonhydrostatic effects are also examined. In the Monterey Bay area, the nonlinear and nonhydrostatic contributions are quite small. Moreover, the authors investigate the character of internal tide generation and find that in the Monterey Bay area the generated baroclinic tides are mainly linear and in the form of internal tidal beams. Comparison of the modeled tidal conversion to previous theoretical estimates shows that they are consistent with one another. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

In relative terms the observed rates are unusually large, of order 10{\%} per century. Periods of greatest change, however, are inconsistent among the stations, and roughly half the stations show increasing amplitude since the late 1990s. Excepting the Gulf of Maine, lunar tides are either static or slightly increasing in amplitude; a few stations show decreases. Large changes in solar, but not lunar, tides suggest causes related to variable radiational forcing, but the hypothesis is at present unproven. Citation: Ray, R. D.

However, the generation and operation of these systems is time-consuming, requires expertise in both information technologies and modeling of coastal processes, and needs dedicated computational power. The new service OPENCoastS overcomes these difficulties by generating on-demand coastal circulation forecast systems through a web platform with minimal user intervention. Using a web platform, the user is guided through seven simple steps to generate an operational forecast system for any coastal region. The only requirements are an unstructured grid of the study area and information on river flow, if applicable. The platform provides ocean and atmospheric forcings and data for model validation, and includes interfaces for results visualization and forecasts management. Forecasts are generated with the community model SCHISM, and computing resources are provided through the European Open Science Cloud.},

Here we present E3SM global simulations using active ocean and sea ice that are driven by the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments II (CORE-II) interannual atmospheric forcing data set. The E3SM ocean and sea ice components are MPAS-Ocean and MPAS-Seaice, which use the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) framework and run on unstructured horizontal meshes. For this study, grid cells vary from 30 to 60 km for the low-resolution mesh and 6 to 18 km at high resolution. The vertical grid is a structured z-star coordinate and uses 60 and 80 layers for low and high resolution, respectively. The lower-resolution simulation was run for five CORE cycles (310 years) with little drift in sea surface temperature (SST) or heat content. The meridional heat transport (MHT) is within observational range, while the meridional overturning circulation at 26.5°N is low compared to observations. The largest temperature biases occur in the Labrador Sea and western boundary currents (WBCs), and the mixed layer is deeper than observations at northern high latitudes in the winter months. In the Antarctic, maximum mixed layer depths (MLD) compare well with observations, but the spatial MLD pattern is shifted relative to observations. Sea ice extent, volume, and concentration agree well with observations. At high resolution, the sea surface height compares well with satellite observations in mean and variability.},

The next step will be a hybrid modelling approach, coupling physical process models with the versatility of data-driven machine learning.},

@article{Arbic2004,
abstract = {This paper examines the accuracy of surface elevations in a forward global numerical model of 10 tidal constituents. Both one-layer and two-layer simulations are performed. As far as the authors are aware, the two-layer simulations and the simulations in a companion paper (Deep-Sea Research II, 51 (2004) 3043) represent the first published global numerical solutions for baroclinic tides. Self-consistent forward solutions for the global tide are achieved with a convergent iteration procedure for the self-attraction and loading term. Energies are too large, and elevation accuracies are poor, unless substantial abyssal drag is present. Reasonably accurate tidal elevations can be obtained with a spatially uniform bulk drag cd or horizontal viscosity KH, but only if these are inordinately large. More plausible schemes concentrate drag over rough topography. The topographic drag scheme used here is based on an exact analytical solution for arbitrary small-amplitude terrain, and supplemented by dimensional analysis to account for drag due to flow-splitting and low-level turbulence as well as that due to breaking of radiating waves. The scheme is augmented by a multiplicative factor tuned to minimize elevation discrepancies with respect to the TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P)-constrained GOT99.2 model. The multiplicative factor may account for undersampled small spatial scales in bathymetric datasets. An optimally tuned multi-constituent one-layer simulation has an RMS elevation discrepancy of 9.54cm with respect to GOT99.2, in waters deeper than 1000m and over latitudes covered by T/P (66∘N to 66∘S). The surface elevation discrepancy decreases to 8.90cm (92 percent of the height variance captured) in the optimally tuned two-layer solution. The improvement in accuracy is not due to the direct surface elevation signature of internal tides, which is of small amplitude, but to a shift in the barotropic tide induced by baroclinicity. Elevations are also more accurate in the two-layer model when pelagic tide gauges are used as the benchmark, and when the T/P-constrained TPXO6.2 model is used as a benchmark in deep waters south of 66∘S. For Antarctic diurnal tides, the improvement in forward model elevation accuracy with baroclinicity is substantial. The optimal multiplicative factor in the two-layer case is nearly the same as in the one-layer case, against initial expectations that the explicit resolution of low-mode conversion would allow less parameterized drag. In the optimally tuned two-layer M2 solution, local values of the ratio of temporally averaged squared upper layer speed to squared lower layer speed often exceed 10.},

abstract = {This study applies a baroclinic‐coupled depth‐integrated modeling system to the North Atlantic Ocean, where an unstructured mesh is used to focus resolution down to ∼30 m along the coasts of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Ocean baroclinicity is incorporated through one‐way coupling from operational data‐assimilated Global Ocean Forecasting System 3.1 temperature and salinity fields at just 12{\%} additional computational time. The main objectives are to provide a comprehensive analysis of observed and modeled coastal sea levels (spanning from seasonal to supertidal variations) in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands during 2017 and to evaluate the associated model performance with and without baroclinic coupling at 14 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Ocean Service tide gauges deployed in the region. It is found that baroclinic coupling increases modeled energy across the entire frequency spectrum, which is more commensurate with observations. In particular, density‐driven effects such as the seasonal cycle and sea level setdown due to trailing cold wakes from passing hurricanes are largely reproduced. Supertidal shelf‐resonant seiching at one to two cycles per hour is observed and modeled at a number of locations, where excitation of these modes is often promoted by the baroclinic coupling. Baroclinicity improves the yearlong model skill at every tide gauge, where the mean total skill is increased from 87{\%} to 93{\%} accuracy (54{\%} to 85{\%} for the nontidal residual). In September 2017 during Hurricanes Irma and Maria, baroclinicity increases model skill at 10 out of 14 tide gauges even when the barotropic mode is adjusted to have no mean offset from the observations.},

Here, we present a novel database on TC characteristics on a global scale using a newly developed synthetic resampling algorithm we call STORM (Synthetic Tropical cyclOne geneRation Model). STORM can be applied to any meteorological dataset to statistically resample and model TC tracks and intensities. We apply STORM to extracted TCs from 38 years of historical data from IBTrACS to statistically extend this dataset to 10,000 years of TC activity. We show that STORM preserves the TC statistics as found in the original dataset. The STORM dataset can be used for TC hazard assessments and risk modeling in TC-prone regions.},

abstract = {Detailed simulations, comparisons with observations, and model sensitivity experiments are presented for the August 2011 tropical cyclone Irene and a March 2010 nor'easter that affected the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area. These storms brought strong winds, heavy rainfall, and the fourth and seventh highest gauged storm tides (total water level), respectively, at the Battery, NYC. To dissect the storm tides and examine the role of various physical processes in controlling total water level, a series of model experiments was performed where one process was omitted for each experiment, and results were studied for eight different tide stations. Neglecting remote meteorological forcing (beyond ∼250 km) led to typical reductions of 7–17{\%} in peak storm tide, neglecting water density variations led to typical reductions of 1–13{\%}, neglecting a parameterization that accounts for enhanced wind drag due to wave steepness led to typical reductions of 3–12{\%}, and neglecting atmospheric pressure gradient forcing led to typical reductions of 3–11{\%}. Neglecting freshwater inputs to the model domain led to reductions of 2{\%} at the Battery and 9{\%} at Piermont, 14 km up the Hudson River from NYC. Few storm surge modeling studies or operational forecasting systems incorporate the “estuary effects” of freshwater flows and water density variations, yet joint omission of these processes for Irene leads to a low-bias in storm tide for NYC sites like La Guardia and Newark Airports (9{\%}) and the Battery (7{\%}), as well as nearby vulnerable sites like the Indian Point nuclear plant (23{\%}).},

This study numerically simulated tsunami inundation by comparing the experimental results with numerical results reproduced by the DFM using roughness parameterizations. The validation of the DFM reveals that it can express the effect of the flow direction and inundation ratio, and it improves the estimation of inundated extent, maximum inundation depth, and arrival time when compared with other roughness parameterizations. This technique requires careful validation of inundation characteristics and mesh size dependency, and future work to improve estimates of the drag coefficient for the prototype scale and incident wave conditions is recommended.},

abstract = {Expedient prediction of storm surge is required for emergency managers to make critical decisions for evacuation, structure closure, and other emergency responses. However, time-dependent storm surge models do not exist for fast and accurate prediction in very short periods on the order of seconds to minutes. In this paper, a time-dependent surrogate model of storm surge is developed based on an artificial neural network with synthetic simulations of hurricanes. The neural network between six input hurricane parameters and one target parameter, storm surge, is trained by a feedforward backpropagation algorithm at each of 92 uniform time steps spanning 45.5 h for each storm. The basis data consist of 446 tropical storms developed from a joint probability model that was based on historical tropical storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Each of the 446 storms was modeled at high fidelity using a coupled storm surge and nearshore wave model. Storm surge is predicted by the 92 trained networks for approaching hurricane climatological and track parameters in a few seconds. Furthermore, the developed surrogate model is validated with measured data and high-fidelity simulations of two historical hurricanes at four points in southern Louisiana. In general, the neural networks at or near the boundary between land and ocean are well trained and model predictions are of similar accuracy to the basis modeling suites. Networks based on modeling results from complex inland locations are relatively poorly trained.},

abstract = {A general, numerical, marching procedure is presented for the calculation of the transport processes in three-dimensional flows characterised by the presence of one coordinate in which physical influences are exerted in only one direction. Such flows give rise to parabolic differential equations and so can be called three-dimensional parabolic flows. The procedure can be regarded as a boundary-layer method, provided it is recognised that, unlike earlier published methods with this name, it takes full account of the cross-stream diffusion of momentum, etc., and of the pressure variation in the cross-stream plane. The pressure field is determined by: first calculating an intermediate velocity field based on an estimated pressure field; and then obtaining appropriate correction so as to satisfy the continuity equation. To illustrate the procedure, calculations are presented for the developing laminar flow and heat transfer in a square duct with a laterally-moving wall.

abstract = {To take into account the change of surface roughness length induced by ocean waves, a coupled atmospheric and ocean wave model system is developed. A two-way coupling is done between a mesoscale atmospheric model, MC2, and an oceanic wave model, a regional version of WAM Cycle-4. Two different approaches, based on the wave age of Smith et al. and the wave-induced stress of Janssen, are used to compute a coupling parameter, called the Charnock parameter, expressed as the nondimensional surface roughness length. The coupling between the two models is accomplished by the use of this parameter, which is a function of sea state, instead of the constant value obtained from empirical studies using the well-known Charnock relation. The coupled atmospheric and ocean wave system was applied to four intense storms in the western Atlantic, to examine the impact of the two-way interaction using real midlatitude storm cases. In Part I, the atmospheric forecasts resulting from this two-way coupling are discussed for these different synoptic cases. The two approaches are evaluated by comparing atmospheric outputs obtained from the coupled and uncoupled systems against buoy observations. The authors conclude that, at least for short-term forecasts, the effects of sea-state-dependent surface roughness on the evolution and synoptic-scale aspects of the storm are rather weak, while small beneficial effects are noted on surface variables. The most significant changes are a reduction of about 10{\%} of the surface winds associated with enhanced surface roughness lengths in areas of younger and rougher seas. The coupling also modifies the sea surface fluxes by as much as 30{\%}, but these are not located in the active areas of the storm. Consequently, precipitation only increases slightly and does not affect the storm development. The impact on the ocean wave forecasts is discussed in Part II.},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation (LES) of a wind turbine under uniform inflow is performed using an actuator line model (ALM). Predictions from four LES research codes from the wind energy community are compared. The implementation of the ALM in all codes is similar and quantities along the blades are shown to match closely for all codes. The value of the Smagorinsky coefficient in the subgrid-scale turbulence model is shown to have a negligible effect on the time-averaged loads along the blades. Conversely, the breakdown location of the wake is strongly dependent on the Smagorinsky coefficient in uniform laminar inflow. Simulations are also performed using uniform mean velocity inflow with added homogeneous isotropic turbulence from a public database. The time-averaged loads along the blade do not depend on the inflow turbulence. Moreover, and in contrast to the uniform inflow cases, the Smagorinsky coefficient has a negligible effect on the wake profiles. It is concluded that for LES of wind turbines and wind farms using ALM, careful implementation and extensive cross-verification among codes can result in highly reproducible predictions. Moreover, the characteristics of the inflow turbulence appear to be more important than the details of the subgrid-scale modeling employed in the wake, at least for LES of wind energy applications at the resolutions tested in this work.},
